# Family Hierarchy — Client Feature Brief

_A plain-language summary of what the Family Hierarchy (shared credits) module does today._

---

## What it is

_Updated 2026-09-10: the member cap was removed and the relationship labels (spouse, son, …) were retired — linked people are simply **Members**, whether family, colleagues, or a company's staff and clients. Bravo Ops can also manage a holder's members from the console._

**Family Hierarchy** lets one Bravo Secure account holder share their Bravo Credits with any number of linked **members** — family or colleagues — in a controlled, fully transparent way.

The account holder invites people, optionally caps how much each can spend, and watches a live usage dashboard. When an invited member books a service, the charge comes straight out of the **holder's wallet** — the member never has to top up their own balance.

Think of it like a family plan with a clear spending picture: one payer, several users, full visibility.

---

## 👥 Roles

- **Account holder** — owns the wallet and the credits. Invites members, sets spend caps, can remove anyone at any time, and sees the full usage breakdown.
- **Member** — accepts an invite and then simply books as normal. Their bookings are paid by the holder automatically. Members can be capped or unlimited.

A person can be an **active member of only one family at a time**.

---

## ✉️ Inviting members

The holder invites people **by phone number**. Two things can happen:

1. **The number already has a Bravo account** — the invite lands in that person's app straight away, ready to accept.
2. **The number isn't registered yet** — the invite is refused with a clear message: the person needs their own Bravo Secure account first. (When Bravo Ops adds members in bulk from the console, the numbers not yet on Bravo come back as a list to follow up.)

At invite time, the holder can optionally set a **spend cap** for that member (e.g. "Alice can use up to 500 credits"). Leave it blank for unlimited use within the holder's balance.

**Built-in safeguards:**

- **No limit** on the number of members.
- You can't invite **yourself**.
- You can't invite someone who's **already active in another family**.
- You can't send a **duplicate** pending invite to the same number.

---

## 🔄 Accepting, declining, and leaving

### Member side

- A member sees the invite with the holder's name and a short note: _"[Holder] invited you to join their account as a member. You'll be able to use their Bravo Credits."_
- **Accept** → they're linked. From that moment, their bookings are paid by the holder.
- **Decline** → the invite is dismissed and can't be reused.

### Holder side

- The holder can **revoke** any member at any time. The member instantly loses access to the shared credits.
- The member's spending history is kept for the holder's records, but stops updating once they're removed.

Every member sits in one of four clear states: **Pending → Active → (Revoked or Declined)**.

## 💳 How shared credits work

When a member books a service and chooses **"Pay with Bravo Credits"**:

1. The system checks whether the member belongs to a family.
2. **If they do**, the holder's wallet is charged — not the member's.
3. **If they don't**, the member pays from their own wallet as normal (non-members are completely unaffected).

To the member, it's seamless — they just book. The family billing happens automatically behind the scenes.

### Spend caps

If the holder set a cap for a member, it's checked **before** every charge:

| Member | Spent so far | Cap    | Booking of 100 cr?                                |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Alice  | 200 cr       | 500 cr | ✅ Allowed (now 300)                              |
| Bob    | 480 cr       | 500 cr | ❌ Blocked — would exceed the cap                 |
| Carol  | 100 cr       | _none_ | ✅ Allowed — only limited by the holder's balance |

If a member hits their cap, the booking is politely blocked with a message to ask the holder to raise the limit or top up. The holder can **change or remove a cap** at any time.

### Safe by design

Each charge runs as a **single locked transaction** against the holder's wallet. That means two members booking at the exact same moment can't accidentally overspend the balance or slip past a cap — the system processes them one after another and always sees an accurate balance.

## 📊 The credit-usage dashboard

The holder gets a clear, real-time view of where the family's credits are going — similar in spirit to a usage page:

- **Total family spend** — a single headline number across all members.
- **Per-member breakdown** — for each member: their name, how much they've spent (and their cap if set), their **share of the total as a percentage**, and a colour-coded **progress bar**.
- **Recent charges** — the latest family transactions, each showing the date, the amount, and a link to the booking.

Members must already hold a Bravo Secure account before they can be added; the list is searchable by name or phone and loads 50 at a time.

---

## 📱 What members see

- **Before accepting** — a pending invite from the holder, with **Accept** / **Decline**.
- **After accepting** — a "Membership" section on their profile showing who they're linked to, their spend cap (or "Shared credits" if unlimited), and how much they've used.
- **When booking** — "Pay with Bravo Credits" works exactly as it always has. If they ever hit a cap, they get a clear prompt to ask the holder.

Profiles throughout the app reflect the **real signed-in user** — there's no placeholder family data anywhere.
