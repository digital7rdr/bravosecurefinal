/**
 * Schema versions
 *   1 — initial messenger DB (identity, pre_keys, signed_pre_keys, sessions, trusted_identities)
 *   2 — adds messages table
 *   3 — adds media_blobs cache table
 *   4 — adds messages.media_object_key (links message → cached blob for purge wiring)
 *   5 — adds messages.call_meta_json
 *   6 — adds outbox table
 *   7 — outbox PK becomes (client_msg_id, peer_user_id, peer_device_id) so
 *       group fan-out can persist one row per peer (audit P0-N4)
 *   8 — adds seen_envelopes table for persistent receive-side dedup
 *       (audit P0-N6)
 *   9 — adds peer_session_health (bug-hunt #1, persistent
 *       last-success + rebuild-attempt cooldown across cold start;
 *       closes the cold-start free-wipe window in P0-1 mitigation
 *       and bounds the previously-unbounded rebuild-attempt Map P1-7)
 *  10 — adds pending_group_envelopes + pending_admin_actions
 *       (bug-hunt #3 / #5, order-independent group join + rekey;
 *       stashes group ciphertext that arrived before the local
 *       master key landed, and admin actions that arrived
 *       out-of-epoch order, so neither is silently dropped)
 *  11 — adds group_master_keys (audit P0-S3 / P0-S5, moves group
 *       master keys out of plaintext AsyncStorage into the SQLCipher
 *       DB, AES-GCM-wrapped under a SEPARATE keychain entry so a
 *       one-shot extraction of either the SQLCipher key or the group-
 *       wrap key alone does not yield plaintext)
 *  14 — adds mirror_flushed (B-94, persistent backup-mirror flush
 *       ledger: (owner, message_id) → version hash of the last row
 *       version that SUCCESSFULLY reached the server. The boot
 *       catch-up sweep hydrates its dedup from this table so an idle
 *       boot re-uploads NOTHING — previously every boot re-encrypted
 *       and re-uploaded the entire history (fresh AES-GCM IV per row),
 *       so any kill before the trailing signed Merkle commit left the
 *       server bytes ahead of the signed root → the recurring
 *       equal-count `root_mismatch` restore dead-end)
 *  15 — adds outbox.soft_attempts (XO-3/OM-07, escalating backoff counter
 *       for retries that must NOT consume the 10-attempt budget: offline
 *       (SN-04) and server-transient 5xx/429/401. `attempts` stays the
 *       semantic-rejection budget, so the no-budget branch previously had
 *       no counter to index BACKOFF_MS with and froze at the 1s slot)
 *  16 — adds pending_reactions (SYNC-7, durable stash for reactions whose
 *       target message hasn't been stored locally yet; the receive path
 *       ACKs the reaction envelope, so dropping it was permanent loss)
 *  17 — adds messages.envelope_ids_json + messages.receipts_json (SYNC-1,
 *       per-recipient envelope ids so every group member's read receipt
 *       matches, + durable B-116 receipt map so partial progress survives
 *       a restart; readers emit each receipt exactly once)
 *  18 — adds messages.mentions_json + messages.edited_at +
 *       messages.deleted_for_all (@-mentions, edit-sent-message, and
 *       delete-for-everyone). All three must survive a restart: an
 *       in-memory-only edit would show the OLD body after every relaunch,
 *       and an in-memory-only tombstone would resurrect content the author
 *       already retracted for everyone — the worst possible direction for
 *       that bug to fail in.
 *       Also adds pending_mutations (the SYNC-7 stash, one field over: an
 *       edit/delete is a pairwise control envelope that routinely overtakes
 *       the master-key-encrypted text it targets, and the receive path ACKs
 *       it, so a drop is permanent divergence).
 *  19 — adds messages.retract_tokens_json (B-187, per-recipient retract
 *       tokens for group fan-outs — the pair to envelope_ids_json. Without
 *       them the HTTP receipt poll can only probe the FIRST leg, so an
 *       all-legs ✓✓ rule would regress straight back to B-155: group
 *       messages never advancing past one tick).
 *       Also adds drafts (MI-06, per-conversation composer drafts). A draft
 *       is message PLAINTEXT, so it lives here under SQLCipher — never in
 *       AsyncStorage; created idempotently by the DDL block, no row-copy.
 *       Also adds messages.is_forwarded (MM-09, "Forwarded" chip survives
 *       restart; NULL = not forwarded, exactly today's behaviour).
 *  20 — AUDIT-2026-08-13 #14: one physical row per relay envelope. Dedup
 *       sweep (keep the OLDEST row per envelope_id — later ones are
 *       redelivery artifacts) then a partial UNIQUE index on envelope_id.
 *       Pairs with doUpsert's move from INSERT OR REPLACE to
 *       ON CONFLICT(conversation_id, id) DO UPDATE — OR REPLACE resolves
 *       ANY constraint by deleting the conflicting row, so a redelivered
 *       envelope would have silently REPLACED the original message
 *       (losing its reactions/receipts) instead of being rejected.
 */
/*
 * v21 (B-683): undeliverable_legs_json — per-member terminal-destroy map

 *      serializeMessage hash (B-94 root_mismatch class).
 * v22 (B-687): merkle_leaves — persistent Merkle leaf cache for the
 *      incremental-commit shadow mode. Holds sha256 digests of uploaded

 *      and can false-positive inside base64). Like envelope_ids/receipts it
 *      does NOT enter serializeMessage/backupWireV3 — a new mirrored field
