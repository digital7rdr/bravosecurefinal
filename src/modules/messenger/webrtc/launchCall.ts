 * One-call helper for every call-launch site in the app.
 *
 * Centralises peer-resolution + callId-generation so a screen doesn't
 * need to know about CallController, signalling, or dispatcher
 * internals — it just calls `launchCall(navigation, {conversationId,
 * callType})`.
 *
 * Routing rules:
 *   - 1:1 conversation              → CallScreen (existing WebRTC P2P)
 *   - 3+ member group / ops_channel → GroupCallScreen (mediasoup SFU)
 *
 * For groups we ALSO probe `/sfu/rooms/by-conversation/:cid` first so
 * the 2nd member tapping "call" joins the existing room instead of
 * creating a parallel ghost room. The server's createRoom is idempotent
 * by conversationId — this client probe is just a UX optimisation that
 * lets us pass `direction:'incoming'` (skip the ring) when there's
 * already a live call.
