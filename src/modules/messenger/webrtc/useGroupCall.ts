/**
 * useGroupCall — mediasoup-client SFU group call with WhatsApp-style
 * ringing, end-to-end identity binding, and host-only moderation.
 *
 * Lifecycle (matches the server sfu.* protocol verbatim):
 *
 *   1. POST /sfu/rooms (with conversationId)         → opaque roomId
 *      (server reuses the existing room if one is live for this convo)
 *   2. WS  sfu.ring (on outgoing only)               → fans rings to recipients
 *   3. WS  sfu.join {roomId}                          → routerRtpCaps,
 *                                                       send + recv transport params,
 *                                                       participantTag, isHost,
 *                                                       existingProducers
 *   4. Device.load({routerRtpCapabilities})
 *   5. Device.createSendTransport(sendParams)         → relay-only ICE
 *      .on('connect',  ...) → sfu.transport.connect
 *      .on('produce',  ...) → sfu.produce
 *   6. Device.createRecvTransport(recvParams)         → same connect plumbing
 *   7. Broadcast `groupCallPresence` envelope to every other group
 *      member so they can map our opaque participantTag to our display
 *      name. SFU never sees the mapping.
 *   8. produce(local audio + (video if isVideo)) → server fans `sfu.new-producer`
 *   9. for each existing + new producer:
 *        WS sfu.consume → consumerId, rtpParameters
 *        recvTransport.consume → MediaStream tile
 *        WS sfu.consumer.resume → media starts flowing
 *  10. Listen for sfu.muted / sfu.kicked → flip state / leave
 *  11. WS sfu.leave on hangup; clear identity registry.
 *
 * Security:
 *   - DTLS-SRTP terminates between client and the SFU's WebRtcTransport
 *   - Media is SRTP-encrypted on the wire — the SFU forwards SRTP
 *     packets without decrypting
 *   - participantTag is opaque (server-issued randomUUID) — the SFU
 *     access log never sees userIds
 *   - Identity (tag → displayName) ships through the existing E2E
 *     pairwise Signal sessions, never through the SFU

 * teardown so the call keeps running — but the boot hook instance is then

 * hook's leaveInternal, whose refs are null — so ending the call after a
 * restore closed NOTHING and leaked every transport/producer/consumer +
 * the camera/mic until process death.
 *
 * Fix: stash the live handles here (module-level, keyed by roomId) at the
 * end of boot, and rehydrate the restored hook's refs from this holder on
 * the adopt path. The holder is cleared by leaveInternal on real teardown
 * and by the logout reset, so it never outlives the call.

     * and the group-key-lane catch — because they `setState('failed')` and
     * **`return`** instead of throwing. So the two steps that matter to them
     * never ran:
     *
     *   1. The B-343 media release. Tracks are acquired at step 2, long before
     *      the key lane, and were only ever stopped by an explicit End. A boot
     *      that dies after step 2 leaves the camera held, which wedges every
     *      subsequent getUserMedia behind it — the loop B-343's own comment
     *      calls "the 'Call failed' loop".
     *   2. The BS-MINIMIZE-RING registry clear. If the call was minimized while
     *      connecting the hook is unmounted, `setState('failed')` is a no-op,
     *      and the floating bubble hangs on "connecting…" forever. That comment
     *      names "key-wait failure" explicitly — i.e. exactly the site that
     *      could not reach it.
     *
     * ⚠️ DELIBERATELY NOT the other two steps:
     *   - Ring-cancel is gated on `sentRingRef`, which is set AFTER every site
     *     here, so it can never fire from this helper.
     *   - The room reap is guarded by `neverJoined`. At the POST-join sites
     *     `participantTagRef` is already set (`:2178`), so the reap is a no-op
     *     there — and relaxing that guard so a joined failure "leaves properly"
     *     would make the frame take the gateway's host path and EVICT every
     *     peer already in the room.
     *
     * ⚠️ KNOWN GAP, stated rather than hidden (review round 1 corrected an
     * earlier comment here that claimed the opposite): at the PRE-JOIN site
     * `neverJoined` is genuinely true and `createdRoomIdRef` was set at
     * `:1796`, so that IS a site where the outer catch's reap would do real
     * work — and it sends no `sfu.leave` at all. A FrameCryptor-less build can
     * therefore leave a host-owned, zero-participant server room behind.
     * NOT fixed here: the reap's safety rests on `endRoomIfEmptyByHost`
     * refusing unless the caller IS the recorded host and the room is empty
     * (`messenger.gateway.ts:2465-2472`), which is a server invariant this
     * change has not audited. Pinned as a known gap instead of guessed at.
     *
     * ⚠️ This helper does NOT emit `sfu.leave` — the call sites own that, and
     * each already passes its own `roomId`. Adding a second leave here risks
     * the roomId-less fallback that drops every tag on the socket.

           *
           * Step 1 creates the room; step 3 joins it. A boot that dies in
           * between leaves a server-side room with us as host and nobody in
           * it, which the relay then advertises to every other member for
           * its fresh-room grace — the corpse the next caller "joins".
           *
           * THREE constraints, each learned the hard way in review:
           *
           * 1. AFTER the ring-cancel above, never before. Leaving deletes
           *    the room, and `sfu.ring.cancel` is host-gated on a room that
           *    still exists — reaping first made the cancel fail
           *    `not_host`, so everyone we rang kept ringing the full 30s at
           *    a room that was already gone.
           *
           * 2. ONLY when we never joined. With a participant tag this frame
           *    takes the gateway's normal tag path, which runs
           *    `hostTerminatesRoom` — so a boot that threw AFTER a peer had
           *    already answered would evict that peer from a working call.
           *    Post-join teardown belongs to leaveInternal, which already
           *    orders cancel-then-leave correctly.
           *
           * 3. IMMEDIATELY, or not at all — not via `wsRequest`.
           *    NOT because anything is buffered: `emitWithAck` rejects at
           *    once with `transport not open` when the socket is down
           *    (packages/messenger-core/src/transport/client.ts:392), and
           *    `waitForTransportOpen` only polls for up to 10s and then
           *    gives up. The reason is the DELAY itself. `wsRequest` would
           *    send this up to 10s late, and `createRoom` is idempotent
           *    within the room's grace — so the user's retry in that window
           *    gets THE SAME room id and may already have joined it. The
           *    late frame then finds a live tag for the room on this socket,
           *    skips the orphan branch, and takes the ordinary leave path
           *    with `hostTerminatesRoom` — tearing down the call the retry
           *    had just established.
           *    Cost of the trade: a boot that fails mid-reconnect skips the
           *    reap. The relay's 60s zombie sweeper is the backstop, and a
           *    corpse that outlives the grace is no longer handed out.
