/**
 * Backup boot — orchestrates the encrypted-backup state machine at
 * sign-in time. Runs BEFORE the messenger runtime initializes so we
 * can intercept the "fresh install with a server backup" case before
 * installIdentity() writes a brand-new Signal identity that would
 * mask the recoverable one.
 *
 * State machine (executed in order, first match wins):
 *
 *   • RESTORE (fresh install + server backup)
 *       Local SQLCipher key absent (clear-data, new device, reinstall)
 *       AND server has an identity_backups row.
 *       → Push BackupRestoreScreen, do NOT init the runtime yet. The
 *         restore screen will install the identity from the unwrapped
 *         bundle, then call onRuntimeReady() to boot the runtime, then
 *         pull the message mirror.
 *
 *   • RESUME (existing device + backup enabled)
 *       Local key present AND server backup present.
 *       → Init the runtime normally. Start the live mirror so new
 *         messages sync — but the master key isn't held in memory
 *         until the user re-enters their password (from Settings →
 *         Chat Backup → Unlock). Until then, mirror writes are no-ops.
 *
 *   • SUGGEST (existing device, backup not yet enabled, has chats)
 *       Local key present AND no server backup AND user has ≥1
 *       conversation AND has not explicitly skipped the prompt.
 *       → Init the runtime, then defer-navigate to BackupSetup.
 *
 *   • PASSTHROUGH (everything else)
 *       Init the runtime, do nothing else.
 *
 * On a service-disabled server (Supabase keys missing) we treat it
 * the same as PASSTHROUGH — the app keeps working without backup.
 *
 * Logcat: every decision logs `[bravo.backup.boot] <case> ...`.
