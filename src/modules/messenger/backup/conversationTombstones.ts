/**
 * B-594 — persistent record of conversations the user DELETED, so a backup
 * restore cannot hand them straight back.
 *
 * ── THE BUG ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "whatever chat list we delete, it appears for a fraction of a second when
 * the backup thing happens — like those mission chats." Deleting a
 * conversation was a Zustand-only eviction (`removeConversation`): no
 * tombstone, no mirror removal, no server call. The conversation therefore
 * survived in full in `conversation_backups` and `messages_backup`, and the
 * restore's conversation apply re-inserted it — its "is this already live?"
 * guard exists to avoid stomping FRESHER state, so a deliberately-deleted row
 * is precisely the case it waves through. `upsertConversation` unshifts a new
 * row onto `conversationOrder`, so it reappeared at the TOP of the list.
 *
 * The flicker (rather than a permanent resurrection) is the Home screen's
 * server prune deleting it again once `listMine` lands — a network round-trip
 * later. Appear → prune → appear, for as long as the restore streams.
 *
 * ── WHY A SET AND NOT "JUST DELETE IT PROPERLY" ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Both, eventually — but they are different jobs. Purging the mirror is how
 * the backup stops GROWING; this set is how a delete stays honest across a
 * restore that legitimately still holds the rows (an older commit, another
 * device's mirror, a restore started before the delete). Only the second one
 * fixes the founder's flicker, and it is invariant-safe in a way the first is
 * not: see the BACKUP_LOOP notes below.
 *
 * ── BACKUP_LOOP (§2) — WHY THIS IS SUPPRESSION-ONLY ──────────────────────
 *
 * This gate runs at the UPSERT, never at the mirror walk. That distinction is
 * load-bearing:
 *   - I3: every mirrored row is still hashed into the Merkle leaf set.
 *     Filtering what gets PAINTED is not filtering what gets VERIFIED —
 *     filtering the walk would manufacture `rows_count` drift and re-open the
 *     `root_mismatch` class that shipped five times.
 *   - I7: the restore's ledger seed still records every durably-written,
 *     verified row. A suppressed conversation's messages remain in
 *     `pendingBatches`/`flushedIds`; dropping them would make the next sweep
 *     re-upload with fresh IVs, which is the B-94 drift factory.
 *   - I8: reads FAIL OPEN. An uninitialised or unreadable set means "not
 *     deleted", so a storage failure can never hide a live conversation.
 *   - I5: NOT cleared on a backup wipe — see `clearAllConversationTombstones`
 *     for why owner-keying, not wiping, is what closes the account-switch
 *     hazard I5 is really about.
 *   - I9: ids ONLY. A conversation NAME here would be plaintext at rest.
 *
 * ── UN-TOMBSTONING IS NOT OPTIONAL ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A tombstone that never lifts is worse than the bug: re-adding someone to a
 * mission room, or a peer messaging you again after you cleared the thread,
 * would leave them permanently invisible. So a GENUINELY LIVE arrival clears
 * the entry (`clearConversationTombstone`) — the same shape as unblocking a
 * peer. The restore's own replay must NOT clear it, which is why the gate is
 * consulted by the replay path and cleared only by the live one.
