/**
 * B-251 — "the call plays through the loudspeaker even though a headset is
 * connected".
 *
 * Both call screens discovered audio devices twice: `onAudioDeviceChanged`
 * (a TRANSITION) auto-snapped to a headset, while `getAudioDeviceList()` on
 * mount (the SEED) only populated the picker and decided nothing. A headset
 * already connected when the call started fires no transition, so the seed was
 * the only path that ran — and the media-type default won: SPEAKER_PHONE for
 * video, EARPIECE for voice.
 *
 * These pin the decision. The application of it stays in each screen, because
 * CallScreen's `pickAudioRouteNative` carries the BS-CALL-CHOPPY de-dupe guard
 * that keeps Bluetooth SCO from flapping.
