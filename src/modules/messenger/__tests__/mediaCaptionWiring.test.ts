/**
 * B-707 — "I still cannot add message to image before sending, just like
 * WhatsApp we can attach image and can attach msg also." (founder, 2026-08-30)
 *
 * Nothing was broken in the crypto or the wire: `sendMedia` has always accepted
 * `opts.caption`, `productionRuntime` has always put it in the bubble's
 * `content` and shipped it as the message body, and the bubble has always
 * rendered it under the attachment. The gap was entirely in the UI:
 *
 *   1. `MediaPreviewTray` had no caption field ("Captions are intentionally out
 *      of scope" — the header comment this fix replaces), and
 *   2. a SINGLE pick never reached the tray at all. `pickImage` fired it
 *      straight down the media queue, so the one case the founder hits every
 *      day had no surface to type on.
 *
 * Both screens must keep BOTH halves, so this is a source scan: neither screen
 * can be mounted by the node project (they pull op-sqlite / WebRTC / callkeep),
 * and the pure half is pinned separately by `pickedAssets.test.ts`.
 *
 * House rules obeyed (CLAUDE.md): comments are STRIPPED before every absence
 * assertion — each rule below is also written in prose beside the code it
 * guards, and matching the prose would pass vacuously — and the scan is
 * newline-agnostic.
