/**
 * B-302 — escalating a 1:1 call to a group call silently discards the audio
 * route the user had explicitly chosen.
 *
 * `CallScreen.escalateToGroupCall` ends in `navigation.replace('GroupCallScreen',
 * …)`. `replace` UNMOUNTS CallScreen, so everything it held dies with it —
 * including `preferredRouteRef`, which is where both the manual picker
 * (CallScreen.tsx:1386) and the headset auto-snap (:1336) record the route.
 *
 * The fresh GroupCallScreen then starts at `useRef<AudioRoute | null>(null)`.
 * With no preference, the first `onAudioDeviceChanged` takes the "no preference
 * yet" branch and auto-snaps to whatever headset is attached — overriding the
 * user's choice, one device-event after the escalation.
 *
 * Device evidence (Pixel 6a, 2026-07-27, realme Buds Wireless 3 paired and
 * connected throughout — the founder had SPEAKER selected on the 1:1 leg):
 *
 *   10:57:53.707 New device status: available=[EARPIECE, SPEAKER_PHONE, BLUETOOTH], selected=BLUETOOTH
 *   10:57:53.708 RNInCallManager.chooseAudioRoute(): user choose audioDevice = BLUETOOTH
 *
 * Audio went into earbuds on a desk. This is the founder's "also the audio
 * output" report — a lost preference, NOT a dead route (see B-297 for the dead
 * code that merely looked like the cause).
 *
 * A route is a user DECISION. Continuity of the call must carry it; a screen
 * swap is an implementation detail the user did not ask for and cannot see.
 *
 * Both screens mount RN views, so the node project cannot import them —
 * comment-stripped source scan. Both files are CRLF, so nothing here is
 * `\n`-anchored (a `\n` anchor matches nothing and passes VACUOUSLY).
