/**
 * Static source-scan for M15 — the stash-drain replay must apply the SAME gates
 * as the live receive path.
 *
 * A group envelope that arrives before its master key is stashed in
 * `pendingGroupEnvelopes` and replayed later by `replayGroupSealedDecode`. That
 * replay is a THIRD implementation of "decide whether this message may render",
 * alongside the WS and HTTP paths that M5 covers — and it only ever grew the
 * membership gate (P1-N4). The live path drops on three more conditions that the
 * replay did not check at all:
 *
 *   expiry              `:6478`  — a disappearing message whose TTL already ran out
 *   isRestoreTombstoned `:7223`  — a message the user deleted before reinstalling
 *   isPeerBlocked       `:7231`  — a sender the user blocked
 *
 * The blocked-peer hole is the sharp one: BLOCKING A PEER DID NOT STOP THEIR
 * STASHED MESSAGE FROM RENDERING. Block someone whose group message is sitting in
 * the stash, and the next key arrival drains it straight onto the screen. The
 * live path has suppressed that since P2-9; the replay never did.
 *
 * Expiry is the one most likely to fire in practice, and the stash makes it
 * MORE likely than on the live path, not less: an envelope only lands in the
 * stash because a key was missing, so it sits there — by definition — for an
 * unbounded time before the drain runs. A 5-minute disappearing message stashed
 * for an hour is expired long before anyone sees it.
 *
 * WHY THESE MUST BE `return`, NEVER `throw` (drainPendingGroup `:6073-6097`):
 * the caller deletes the stash row only when the replay returns cleanly. A throw
 * is caught, bumps `attempts`, and re-runs the whole replay —
 * `PENDING_GROUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times, re-doing the group parse each pass — before
 * finally deleting the row anyway. A deliberate drop is not an error, so it must
 * complete normally.
 *
 * `productionRuntime.ts` is ~8k lines and no test can import it (see
 * bootGroupStashDrain.test.ts:12), so this pins the parity by reading source, the
 * same way receivePathParity.test.ts pins M5.
 *
 * If this fails, do NOT relax it. See docs/runbooks/MESSAGE_LOOP.md M15 / W8b.
