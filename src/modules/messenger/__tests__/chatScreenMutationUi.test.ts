/**
 * Static source scan of the edit / delete-for-everyone / mention UI in
 * `ChatScreen.tsx`.
 *
 * Why a scan: `ChatScreenInner` is ~1,700 lines with zero tests and commits
 * averaging 34 files (MESSAGE_LOOP §6 "Deferred / parked"), and it cannot be
 * mounted in the node project at all. The behavioural rules these features rest
 * on ARE tested — messageMutationGate, messageMutationApply, mentionText,
 * LinkifiedText.mentions — so what is left, and what only a scan can reach, is
 * whether the screen is wired to them and whether the destructive paths are
 * guarded before they fire.
 *
 * TRAPS this file is written around (each has cost this repo a session):
 *  - line endings. On a CRLF checkout a `\n`-anchored regex matches nothing and
 *    the test passes VACUOUSLY, so `source()` normalizes CRLF away and every
 *    assertion below reads the normalized text.
 *  - prose containing a banned word is the most common false result, so every
 *    absence assertion runs on COMMENT-STRIPPED source.
