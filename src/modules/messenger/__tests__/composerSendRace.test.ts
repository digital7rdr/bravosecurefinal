/**
 * The composer send race — two founder-reported symptoms, ONE root cause.
 *
 * Reported 2026-07-25 on vc166:
 *   1. "i can rapidly type and send - sometime broken sentence send"
 *   2. "sometime i click on send button doesnt looks like response but when
 *       click 2nd time 2 msg send of same context"
 *
 * Both are the controlled-TextInput lag. `onChangeText` fires SYNCHRONOUSLY
 * from native, but `setText` only lands on the next render. Anything reading
 * `text` in the same tick as a keystroke therefore reads a stale value:
 *
 *   - fast type → send  ⇒ `submit` ships the body as it was one or more
 *     keystrokes ago = a truncated "broken sentence";
 *   - tap → tap        ⇒ the first tap cannot clear the state synchronously,
 *     so the second tap still sees the old body and sends it AGAIN.
 *
 * The fix is a ref written synchronously in `onChangeText` and read by
 * `submit`, cleared before any async work so it doubles as the second-tap
 * guard. This file pins that the ref stays the single source of truth — the
 * failure mode of a partial fix is that ONE writer of `text` forgets the ref
 * and re-opens the race for whichever path it owns.
 *
 * B-73 is the precedent for why the native `.clear()` also has to stay.
 *
 * Source scan because `ChatScreen.tsx` cannot be imported by the node project
 * (it pulls react-native + webrtc), same as chatScreenMutationUi.test.ts.
 * TRAP: line endings. On a CRLF checkout a bare `\n` anchor matches nothing and
 * the scan passes VACUOUSLY, so `source()` normalizes CRLF away.
