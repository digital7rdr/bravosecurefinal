/**
 * Static source scan of the edit / delete-for-everyone wiring in
 * `productionRuntime.ts`.
 *
 * Why a source scan and not a unit test: no test imports `productionRuntime.ts`
 * — it transitively pulls in react-native and cannot load in the node jest
 * project. That is exactly the hole B-124/B-125 went through, and it is why
 * this repo pins unreachable rules by reading the file as TEXT
 * (messageTopologyInvariants, receivePersistenceInvariants, receivePathParity).
 *
 * The DECISIONS are tested for real elsewhere — messageMutationGate.test.ts and
 * messageMutationApply.test.ts. What can only be pinned here is that the
 * production receive and send paths are actually WIRED to them: a lane that is
 * never called is invisible to a behavioural test and green everywhere.
 *
 * TRAPS this file is written around (both have cost this repo a session):
 *  - line endings. On a CRLF checkout a `\n`-anchored regex matches nothing and
 *    the test passes VACUOUSLY, so `runtimeSource()` normalizes CRLF away and
 *    every assertion below reads the normalized text.
 *  - Prose containing a banned word is the most common false result, so every
 *    ordering/absence assertion runs on COMMENT-STRIPPED source.
