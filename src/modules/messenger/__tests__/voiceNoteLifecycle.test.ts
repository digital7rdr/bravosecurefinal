/**
 * B-148 / B-149 — voice-note recorder lifecycle + plaintext cleanup.
 *
 * `VoiceNoteRecorder.tsx` imports react-native AND expo-av at module
 * scope, and `ChatScreen.tsx` is a 3k-line RN screen — neither can be
 * loaded by the node `messenger-crypto` project, and stubbing expo-av's
 * `Audio.Recording` well enough to exercise a stop/stop race would be a
 * test of the stub, not the component. So these rules are pinned the way
 * this repo already pins everything inside `productionRuntime.ts`: by
 * reading the source (see messageTopologyInvariants.test.ts).
 *
 * That makes them REGRESSION tests, not proofs of behaviour — they fail
 * the moment a refactor drops a guard, which is exactly the failure mode
 * these four defects represent. The behavioural half needs a device pass
 * (record → send → play; record → navigate away; Send+Delete double-tap).
 *
 * DO NOT relax these. Each corresponds to a specific reported defect:
 *   (a) iOS audio session left in playAndRecord ⇒ later playback quiet
 *   (b) stop() re-entrancy ⇒ one clip both SENT and CANCELLED
 *   (c) no unmount teardown ⇒ hot mic + retained temp file
 *   (d) wall-clock duration ⇒ wrong length shipped to the recipient
 *   B-149 the plaintext capture was never deleted after encryption
