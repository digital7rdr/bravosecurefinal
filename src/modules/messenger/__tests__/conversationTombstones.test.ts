/**
 * B-594 — "whatever chat list we delete, it appears for a fraction of a second
 * when the backup thing happens."
 *
 * Deleting a conversation was a Zustand-only eviction: no tombstone, no mirror
 * removal, no server call. The backup therefore kept the conversation in full,
 * and the restore's conversation apply — whose "already live?" guard exists to
 * avoid stomping FRESHER state — read a deliberately-deleted row as "not live,
 * safe to restore" and handed it straight back at the TOP of the list. The Home
 * screen's server prune then removed it again once `listMine` landed, one
 * network round-trip later. Appear → prune → appear, for the whole restore.
 *
 * The risk in the FIX is the mirror image: a tombstone that never lifts would
 * make a re-added mission room, or a peer who messages you after you cleared
 * the thread, permanently invisible. So both directions are pinned here.

 * Every gate in this module FAILS OPEN — uninitialised means "not deleted", so
 * that a storage failure can never hide a live conversation (BACKUP_LOOP I8).
 * The cost of that correct choice is that a feature which is never LOADED looks
 * exactly like a feature with nothing to suppress: `cached` stays null,
 * `rememberDeletedConversation` early-returns, and every behavioural test above
 * still passes because they load the set themselves.
 *
 * The first draft shipped exactly that — the loader was called only from this
 * file. `productionRuntime.ts` cannot be imported by the node project, so the
 * wiring is pinned by a source scan, the same way the rest of that file's
 * boot contract is.
