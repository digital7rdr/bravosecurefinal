/**
 * M-04 (audit 2026-07-06) — store-driven message banners for the WARM
 * background path.
 *
 * Sealed sender means a msg-wake FCM frame names only the sender, so a GROUP
 * message can never be resolved to its conversation from the push payload —
 * which broke per-conversation collapse, mute suppression, and tap routing
 * for groups. But on the warm path the messenger runtime DOES decrypt the
 * message into messengerStore. This module subscribes to the store and,
 * while the app is backgrounded/inactive, posts a conv-keyed notifee banner
 * for each NEW inbound message in a non-muted, non-active conversation —
 * giving groups correct collapse + mute + tap. The banner text stays generic
 * ('New message'); the title is the conversation's display name, which is
 * allowed because it is derived locally from the store, never from the wire.
 *
 * The killed-app path cannot run this (no runtime, no decrypt), so killed
 * group wakes stay generic sender-keyed banners — documented residual gap.
 *
 * Idempotent start; stopped (and its banners cleared) on sign-out via
 * stopFcmBootstrap.
