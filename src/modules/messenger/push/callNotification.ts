/**
 * Production-grade incoming-call notifications backed by notifee.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   When the app is backgrounded or the device is locked, the existing
 *   in-app incoming-call screens (IncomingGroupCallScreen for SFU
 *   group calls, CallScreen with isIncoming for 1:1) can't pop up on
 *   their own — JS isn't running, or running but can't navigate. The
 *   user just sees nothing and the call goes unanswered.
 *
 *   This module fixes that with a notifee call-style notification:
 *
 *     - High-importance channel (IMPORTANCE_HIGH = sound + vibration +
 *       heads-up display)
 *     - Category 'call' so Android treats it as a real call (lock-screen
 *       priority, bypass DND if user allows)
 *     - fullScreenAction: 'default' — when device is LOCKED, Android
 *       launches the app full-screen the moment the notification
 *       arrives (this is what makes "phone rings on lock screen" work)
 *     - Accept / Decline actions inline so the user can answer without
 *       unlocking
 *     - Persistent (`autoCancel: false`, `ongoing: true`) — the
 *       notification stays until we explicitly dismiss it on
 *       answer/decline/hangup
 *     - Custom default ringtone (the OS-default for incoming calls)
 *
 *   The full-screen launch brings MainActivity to foreground; the
 *   existing ring dispatchers (callDispatcher / groupCallRingDispatcher)
 *   then navigate to the right ring screen. So the visible "real UI"
 *   the user sees is the existing IncomingGroupCallScreen /
 *   CallScreen — notifee is JUST the wake-up bridge.
 *
 *   Tap actions ('accept-...' / 'decline-...') are handled in
 *   fcmBootstrap.ts via notifee.onForegroundEvent +
 *   notifee.onBackgroundEvent so we can dismiss + route correctly even
 *   when the user taps from the notification shade.

 * exists for: a ring drawn while the device was in Doze (or drawn moments

 * `getDisplayedNotifications`, so on the next launch the user found a dead call
 * ringing at them — with the native looping ringtone still going, because that
 * survives JS VM death by design.
 *
 * Run on boot and on foreground. Judges a call dead by the SAME cross-lane
 * signals the ring handler uses, plus TTL expiry (a ring older than the ring
 * window cannot be live even if no tombstone was ever written — the process
 * that would have written it is gone).
 *
 * Routes every cancel through `dismissCallNotif`, never a bare
 * `cancelNotification`: the ringtone stop lives in that funnel, and a bare
 * cancel leaves the phone ringing with no notification to stop it.
