/**
 * Scope v2 Phase 4 — the ONE membership source for every company-file surface.
 *
 * The scope of the company shelf IS the channel list (see companyShelf.ts), so
 * if a screen could assemble that list itself it could pass a wider one — a
 * filter to forget, which is the shape this phase was warned about. Screens get
 * a finished answer and no way to widen it.
 *
 * `listChannels` is the server's membership-scoped result, refetched on focus:
 * a member removed from a channel loses its files the next time they open the
 * surface, with no local invalidation to get wrong.
 *
 * NOT fetched for a non-org account. Running it unconditionally made every
 * personal user issue `GET /department/channels` on each focus — three DB
 * queries and a logged 403 apiece — for a shelf they can never see. Narrowing,
 * never widening: `isOrgAffiliated` is the same flag that decides whether the
 * shelf exists at all.
