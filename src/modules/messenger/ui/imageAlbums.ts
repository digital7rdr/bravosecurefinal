/**
 * B-287 / B-288 — photos in a thread, as a set rather than N loose messages.
 *
 * Founder, two requests that turn out to be one idea:
 *   "when images are sent multiple like WhatsApp they are like one album, they
 *    are not coming one by one"
 *   "when one image opens, if we swipe right or left we should see the next or
 *    previous image"
 *
 * Both need the same thing the chat never had: an ORDER over the pictures in a
 * conversation. Grouping is how it is drawn, paging is how it is browsed, and
 * they must agree — an album that shows 4 tiles the swipe cannot reach would be
 * worse than no album.
 *
 * Pure (no React, no react-native) so the node project can test it for real,
 * same convention as `chatListItems.ts` / `chatListLayout.ts` next door.
 *
 * WIRE FORMAT IS UNCHANGED. Each photo is still its own sealed-sender message
 * with its own AES key; this module only decides how existing rows are drawn
 * and traversed. A real multi-part album would change the envelope shape, which
 * is a documented stop condition — do not "improve" this by inventing one.
