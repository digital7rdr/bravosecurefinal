 * B-703 MR-2/MR-3 — give a message back the thread it belongs to.
 *
 * THE SYMPTOM: "I can see the message in the notification but not in the chat."
 *
 * Messages are durable — the receive txn commits them to SQLCipher and acks the
 * relay, so the envelope is gone from the server. The CONVERSATION row is not:
 * it lives in the zustand vault behind a 500 ms trailing debounce that resets on
 * every `set()`. Two independent ways it goes missing:
 *   - MR-2: the killed-app drain mints the row and Android freezes the headless
 *     VM before the debounce fires.
 *   - MR-3: `onRehydrateStorage` REPLACES `conversations` wholesale from the
 *     vault slice, so a row minted by an ingest that beat rehydration is
 *     clobbered.
 * Either way the message rows survive and `hydrateMessages` never mints a
 * conversation for them — it only patches rows that already exist. The thread
 * is then invisible in the chat list and the banner's tap resolves to nothing,
 * landing the user on the home screen.
 *
 * This is a REPAIR, not a new minter: it re-derives what was lost from the rows
 * that survived, and it is idempotent. Run it after BOTH hydration paths so
 * whichever lands last heals the other.
 *
 * It honours every rule the live minter honours, because resurrecting the wrong
 * thing is worse than the bug: a deleted conversation stays deleted (B-594
 * tombstone, consulted with the NEWEST row's composed time so genuinely newer
 * traffic still lifts it), `direct:<self>` is never a chat (B-124), an ad-hoc
 * call group never grows a chat-list row (B-106), and a peer that already has a
 * server-UUID row does not get a synthetic twin (the home list would show the
 * same peer twice; ChatScreen already unions both slots).
 *
 * Returns the number of rows repaired.

 * B-124/B-125 — heal devices already contaminated by call escalation.
 *
 * The code fix (messagingLogic's `direct` veto) stops NEW contamination, but
 * an affected device keeps its persisted wreckage forever: `ensureCallGroupKey`
 * files a throwaway `'Call'` GroupState onto chat-bearing direct-shaped ids
 * (`direct:<own userId>` and the originating 1:1 id), nothing ever un-aliases
 * them, the ad-hoc group is never registered server-side so /conversations/mine
 * cannot reconcile it, and neither existing prune can reach it —
 * `pruneCallGroupGhostRows` skips `type !== 'group'` and MessengerHomeScreen's
 * sweep only matches dashed UUIDs.
 *
 * Two precise signals, both of which survive `partialize` (it strips only
 * `masterKeyB64`; the doc comment above it confirms `name` is retained):
 *
 *  1. GROUP-KEY ALIASES — `direct:`-shaped id carrying the exact `'Call'`
 *     sentinel. A real group id is a server UUID or 32-hex and is NEVER
 *     `direct:`-prefixed, so this cannot match a genuine group. This is why the
 *     sweep is safe here even though masterKeyB64 has been stripped at
 *     rehydrate: it keys off the id SHAPE and the name, never off key presence.
 *
 *  2. THE SELF-SLOT ROW — `direct:<own userId>`. You can never hold a 1:1 with
 *     yourself, so such a row is definitionally invalid. This is the duplicate
 *     thread the user sees, relabelled with the peer's name by the home list.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used as a signal: "has a 'Call' alias and <= 1 participant".
 * The `:4442-4443` alias targets the ORIGINATING conversation — a real chat —
 * and a cold-contact row legitimately has `participants: [peer]`, so that rule
 * would delete a genuine conversation. Removing its alias (1) is enough to
 * un-break it; the row itself must be left alone.
 *
 * `s.messages` is intentionally untouched — orphaned rows are invisible and
 * harmless, and deleting them would destroy real user messages that were
 * mis-routed into the ghost. Same convention as pruneCallGroupGhostRows.
