/**
 * SQLCipher-backed message store.
 *
 * Spec compliance: per Bravo Secure architecture v1.0 R1 §2.2 the
 * client-side message store is "SQLCipher-encrypted local SQLite
 * database. Message keys are derived per-session and stored separately
 * from message ciphertext." This module owns the messages table inside
 * the same SQLCipher DB that holds Signal Protocol session state, with
 * page-level encryption from a hardware-bound key (keychain).
 *
 * The Zustand store remains the read path for the UI (fast in-memory
 * lookup); this store is the durable write path. On boot the runtime
 * loads everything here back into Zustand. Every mutation that flows
 * through messengerStore also fans out here via a subscribe-based
 * mirror in productionRuntime.
 *
 * Schema lives in `crypto/db.ts` (messages table + indexes). Bumping
 * the columns here requires bumping SCHEMA_VERSION in db.ts — schema v23
 * (B-837) added `media_name`, a DERIVED search column written by `doUpsert`
 * from `media_meta.name`. It is deliberately absent from `rowToMessage`:
 * `media_meta` stays the single source of truth for the UI, and the column
 * exists only so `searchContent` can match a file name without LIKE-ing over
 * `media_meta_json` (which also carries base64 thumbnails). It must never
 * enter `serializeMessagePayload` — a mirrored field re-hashes every row
 * (BACKUP_LOOP I1).

   * B-636 (client, 2026-08-23) — "this search option should allow you to also
   * search for conversations or words in conversations that's inside the chats."
   *
   * Substring search over decrypted message BODIES, newest-first, scoped to an
   * explicit conversation-id allow-list. Exactly like `loadLinkMessages` above:
   * the relay only ever holds ciphertext, so a server-side index cannot exist
   * and this local scan is the only possible source.
   *
   * ── THE ALLOW-LIST IS THE SCOPE BOUNDARY, not a filter applied afterwards ──
   *
   * The caller passes the conversation ids of the channels IT is already
   * showing, and those are organisation-scoped upstream (B-624). So a query
   * typed on the Channels tab can never surface another organisation's message,
   * and never a 1:1. An EMPTY array therefore means "nothing is in scope" and
   * returns nothing — it must never be read as "no filter", which is how a
   * scoped query quietly becomes a global one.
   *
   * ── LIKE WILDCARDS IN THE USER'S OWN TEXT ARE ESCAPED ─────────────────────
   *
   * Without that a typed `%` matches every message and `_` matches any single
   * character: a wrong result AND an unbounded scan. `loadLinkMessages` needed
   * no escaping because its pattern is a literal; this one is user input.
   *
   * Excludes the rows the thread itself hides: expired disappearing messages
   * (mirroring `loadOlder`/`loadLinkMessages`) and delete-for-everyone
   * tombstones. `messageMutationApply` already blanks a tombstone's body, so
   * the second exclusion is depth rather than the only defence — but a search
   * that could resurrect deleted text is precisely the class this repo has
   * shipped before (B-594/B-605), so it is asserted rather than assumed.
   *
   * ── B-837: MEDIA IS SEARCHABLE, AND THE NAME COLUMN IS THE ONLY NAME SOURCE ─
   *
   * A picture's note and a video's caption were always in `content`; only the
   * old `type = 'text'` predicate hid them. A document's file name is matched
   * through the derived `media_name` column (schema v23), NOT through
   * `media_meta_json` — that column also carries `thumbB64`, a base64 JPEG up
   * to ~20 KB per image row, so a LIKE over it would scan megabytes per
   * keystroke and could match inside the base64 rather than in anything the
   * user typed.
   *
   * The type filter inverts rather than disappears: `call` rows are call
   * records, not messages, and `system` rows carry prose nobody wrote ("X added
   * Y", "A message couldn't be decrypted") which would otherwise answer half
   * the queries in a busy channel. A recorded voice note carries no name and no
   * caption, so it is not text-searchable at all — the Files → VOICE tab is its
   * door, and a "voice" keyword match would be a lie in every other language.
