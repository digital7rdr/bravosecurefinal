/**
 * Durable outbox.
 *
 * Why: the WS send path is fire-and-forget. If the app is killed (Doze,
 * swipe, low-memory) between `transport.send()` and the server's
 * `envelope.accepted`, the message lives only in the Zustand store as
 * `status: 'sending'` with no retry mechanism — it's gone. WhatsApp
 * persists every outgoing message to disk BEFORE shipping it and only
 * deletes the row after the server confirms. This store does the same.
 *
 * Group fan-out (audit P0-N4): each per-peer envelope is its own row.
 * The PK is composite — (clientMsgId, peerUserId, peerDeviceId) — so a
 * group send to N members enqueues N rows that all carry the same
 * clientMsgId but route to distinct recipients. drainOutbox replays
 * each row independently with per-row retry/backoff.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. enqueue()  — runtime writes BEFORE `transport.send()`.
 *   2. markDelivered() — runtime deletes when `envelope.accepted` (or
 *      HTTP fallback) confirms acceptance for THIS peer.
 *   3. dueRows()  — startup + every `socket.on('connect')` calls this
 *      to pull rows whose `next_retry_at <= now`; runtime re-ships
 *      each via the existing HTTP relay path.
 *   4. recordAttempt() — bumps `attempts` and schedules the next retry
 *      with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 8s, 30s, 2m cap — F-3/B-693).
 *   5. markFailed() — after MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts the row stays in the
 *      DB with `status='failed'` so the UI can surface a retry button.
