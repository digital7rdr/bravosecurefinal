/**
 * RT-3 (XO-1 + XO-2) — deferred outbox payloads + the drain's routing decision.
 *
 * Two loss classes meet here:
 *  - XO-2: a send whose crypto prep could not run (no sender cert on an
 *    offline launch, no session) used to fail-fast with NO outbox row. It is
 *    now persisted as an INTENT (`deferred: true`); the drain re-seals it with
 *    a fresh cert + session when connectivity returns. A4 already did this
 *    per-peer inside the group fan-out; these shapes generalise it.
 *  - XO-1: a fully-sealed 1:1/reaction row queued past the ~1h sender-cert TTL
 *    used to ship verbatim; the recipient destroys an expired cert BEFORE
 *    libsignal decrypt while the relay answers 200 — silent loss behind a
 *    'sent' tick. Rows now carry `certExpSec` + re-seal inputs (SN-06 parity),
 *    so the drain re-mints instead.
 *
 * Kept free of native/runtime imports (type-only imports are erased) so it can
 * be unit-tested without standing up productionRuntime — same rationale as
 * `outboxCertFreshness.ts`.
