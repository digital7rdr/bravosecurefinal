/**
 * B-126 (2026-07-21) — in-flight envelope registry with stale eviction.
 *
 * The WS deliver path and the HTTP drain both guard against concurrent
 * double-decrypt of the same envelope via an in-flight id set (audit
 * L16). That set assumed entries are always released by a `finally` —
 * but a wedged receive frame (the B-126 chain stall) never resolves, so
 * its ids stayed in-flight FOREVER and both paths silently skipped every
 * redelivery of those envelopes: the exact "messages strand until a cold
 * restart" the founder reported, with zero log lines.
 *
 * The registry keeps the double-decrypt guard but bounds it: an entry
 * older than STALE_MS (> the chain watchdog's force-advance deadline, so
 * the chain is unwedged first) is loudly evicted and the new attempt
 * proceeds — redelivery becomes a fresh, processable attempt instead of
 * a silent no-op. Worst case of a false eviction is one duplicate
 * decrypt attempt, which the persistent seen-envelope dedup and
 * libsignal's message-key handling already tolerate.
