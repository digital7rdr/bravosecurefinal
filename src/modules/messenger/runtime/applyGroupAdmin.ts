/**
 * Seam S5 — the group ADMIN lane of `doHandleIncoming`.
 *
 * The largest single lane (350 lines) and the one that stayed inline longest,
 * because it is the security core of group messaging: create-signature
 * verification (G-05 relayed creates included), epoch monotonicity (G1), the
 * B-127 wire-id/signed-id split, master-key install and supersession (MEDIUM-2),
 * and `applyAdminAction` for roster + rekey. Three CLAUDE.md stop-conditions
 * meet in here, so it was extracted only with owner sign-off.
 *
 * MOVED VERBATIM. The body was lifted by a script rather than retyped —
 * transcription risk in this particular code is not worth taking — and only free
 * variables were rewritten into explicit `args`/`deps`. Behaviour is unchanged;
 * the diff is a relocation, not a rewrite. Verify that claim the same way I did:
 * `git show <prev>:productionRuntime.ts`, slice the lane, and compare.
 *
 * The superseded-key registry moved WITH it (below). It is used only by the
 * create path, and leaving it behind would have split one security control
 * across two files.
 *
 * NOT changed while moving, deliberately: the wire-id vs signed-id double lookup
 * (`args.existing` is bound from the WIRE id; `createExisting` from the SIGNED
 * id). That asymmetry looks like a redundancy and is the B-127 P0 fix — an
 * attacker set the wire id to an unused value so `existing` came back undefined
 * and every guard was skipped. Do not "simplify" them into one lookup.
 *
 * See docs/runbooks/MESSAGE_LOOP.md W24/S5 and sqa.md B-127.
