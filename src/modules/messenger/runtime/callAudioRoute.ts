/**
 * B-251 — which audio device a call should start on.
 *
 * THE BUG. Both call screens discovered devices twice, and only one of the two
 * paths made a decision:
 *
 *   - `onAudioDeviceChanged` (a TRANSITION event) → auto-snapped to a headset
 *     the moment one appeared. This is the "plug in mid-call" path.
 *   - `getAudioDeviceList()` on mount (the SEED) → populated the picker list
 *     and stopped there.
 *
 * A headset that was ALREADY connected when the call started produces no
 * transition, so the seed was the only path that ran — and it decided nothing.
 * The media-type default then won: SPEAKER_PHONE for video, EARPIECE for voice.
 * Answering a call with Bluetooth headphones on played the caller through the
 * LOUDSPEAKER, which is both wrong and, in public, a privacy leak.
 *
 * The decision lives here, once, because it was already duplicated across
 * CallScreen and GroupCallScreen — and a behaviour with two hand-copied
 * implementations is exactly how the unwatched copy drifts (this repo's
 * recurring root cause). Each screen still APPLIES the route through its own
 * primitive: CallScreen's `pickAudioRouteNative` carries a de-dupe guard that
 * exists to stop Bluetooth SCO from flapping (BS-CALL-CHOPPY), and routing
 * around it would resurrect that.
