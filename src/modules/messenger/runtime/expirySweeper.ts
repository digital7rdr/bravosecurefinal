/**
 * Disappearing messages — client-side expiry sweep.
 *
 * Poll every `intervalMs` (default 1s for snappy on-screen countdown).
 * Any message whose `expires_at` has passed is hard-removed from the
 * in-memory store. The sweeper has three follow-on responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Server retract — for messages WE sent that still hold a
 *      capability token, fire `POST /envelopes/retract` so the
 *      sealed envelope is pulled off the relay before any offline
 *      recipient could fetch it inside the 30-day dwell.
 *   2. Cache purge — for messages with an attachment, drop the
 *      cached ciphertext blob (`MediaBlobCache.remove`) so the
 *      decrypted-on-demand R2 ciphertext doesn't outlive the
 *      message itself. SQLCipher's page-level encryption protects
 *      the cache but the contract still requires deterministic
 *      eviction on expiry.
 *   3. (Phase 2) Filesystem purge — when we add an on-disk plaintext
 *      cache for thumbnails/previews, delete those here too. Hook is
 *      already wired via the same `purgeBlob` callback.
 *
 * Retract + cache purge are best-effort and run in parallel. Failures
 * never block the sweep cadence — the message is gone from history
 * either way; the cache row is at worst orphaned (LRU evicts it).
