/**
 * Seam S5 — the 1:1 TEXT lane of `doHandleIncoming`.
 *
 * Sibling of `applyGroupText`. Same two drops, and they are DELIBERATELY in the
 * opposite order:
 *
 *   group : tombstone (M-08) -> blocked (P2-9)
 *   1:1   : blocked  (M-07)  -> tombstone (M-08)
 *
 * That divergence is preserved verbatim rather than "tidied" during the move. It
 * is currently harmless — both branches drop, neither notes the envelope, so the
 * only observable difference is which log line is emitted — but a move is not
 * the place to change behaviour, and the tests below pin BOTH orders so the
 * difference is now visible and deliberate instead of accidental. If the drops
 * ever gain different consequences (one noting the envelope, say), this is
 * where that latent inconsistency would turn into a real bug.
 *
 * No membership gate here: 1:1 has no membership concept, and the conversation
 * id is resolved FROM the peer, so a peer cannot address someone else's thread.
 *
 * Everything react-native-tainted is injected, so this module is Tier A and the
 * node jest project can load it — the reason these gates are testable at all.
 *
 * See docs/runbooks/MESSAGE_LOOP.md W24/S5.
