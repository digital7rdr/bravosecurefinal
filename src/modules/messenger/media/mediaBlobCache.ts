 * SQLCipher-backed media blob cache.

 * object key, so a re-view of the same image / voice note doesn't
 * round-trip the storage operator again. The per-file AES-256-CBC
 * decryption key STILL lives in the sealed envelope only — this
 * cache never sees plaintext. Combined with SQLCipher's page-level
 * encryption, on-disk recovery yields nothing without the keychain
 * key.
 *
 * Eviction is opportunistic LRU: every put() that pushes us over
 * `maxBytes` deletes oldest-accessed rows until we're back under
 * the cap. Safe default: 200 MB total — fine for hundreds of
 * voice notes, dozens of photos.
