/**
 * Founder 2026-08-05 — every news link, on Bravo Intel AND My Feed, must be
 * shareable to INTERNAL Bravo contacts and groups ("to encourage a community
 * within the App"). Founder 2026-08-08 — the VBG news surfaces (OSINT threat
 * feed, GeoRisk risk articles) join the same rule.
 *
 * 2026-08-05: deliberately NOT the OS share sheet. 2026-09-04 (B-797): the
 * client asked for it BACK — "share news outside of Bravo, like over WhatsApp
 * or any other platform" — so the sheet now offers BOTH doors; the OS sheet is
 * reachable only from inside the share sheet, never from a bare button that
 * skips the internal picker. The picker reuses `ForwardList`, the same
 * conversation picker the message-forward flow uses, so it inherits that
 * component's exclusion of department channels (forwarding into a broadcast
 * channel would bypass its post-role check).
