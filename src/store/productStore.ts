 * app reopens straight into it; switching products is a deliberate act
 * (Profile → Switch Dashboard) that remounts the product shell, which resets
 * the previous product's navigation stack structurally.
 *
 * `pendingProduct` carries the card the user tapped on the pre-auth product
 * selector through the signup flow; the client shell adopts it on first
 * mount after auth. Only CLIENT accounts consult this store — agent/CPO/
 * agency shells are chosen by `resolveAuthedRoute` before it is read.
