/**
 * Family last-location reporter (Linked Members, founder spec 2026-08-04).
 *
 * While the signed-in user is an ACTIVE, non-held family member, their device
 * reports its last fix to the plan owner's Linked Members screen — foreground
 * only (same lifecycle idiom as `vbgTelemetry`), every ~10 minutes plus on
 * each return to foreground.
 *
 * Privacy posture:
 *  - Membership is confirmed BEFORE any coordinate leaves the device — a
 *    non-member's fix is never read or sent, and a negative answer backs off
 *    for hours.
 *  - B-843/A3 — that confirmation reads EVERY root (`memberships()`, falling
 *    back to the single `membership()` on a ≤1.0.306 server), and it decides
 *    nothing else. It used to read ONE row and apply its own hold logic, so a
 *    person on two plans whose OLDEST root had them on hold went dark for six
 *    hours while a second root was entitled to their location. Holds, revokes
 *    and `location_scope` now belong entirely to the server's `{reported:false}`
 *    answer, which re-arms the backoff below.
 *  - The permission check is silent (`PermissionsAndroid.check`) — this
 *    service never prompts; location permission is asked in-context by the
 *    onboarding/mission flows.
