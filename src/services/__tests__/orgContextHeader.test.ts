 * Stamped in the shared request interceptor rather than per-screen, because a
 * screen forgetting is invisible: the request succeeds, just against the wrong
 * company. There is no error to notice.
 *
 * The header cannot widen access — the server treats it as a request and
 * narrows the caller's real memberships by it (`org-context.ts`,
 * `multiOrgContext.spec.ts`). What these pin is the CLIENT half: sent when a
 * workspace is selected, absent when none is, and never rewritten underneath an
 * in-flight request.
