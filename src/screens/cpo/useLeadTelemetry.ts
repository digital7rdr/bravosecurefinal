/**
 * LM-C5 (foreground half) — the LEAD's GPS push previously ran ONLY while the
 * live-tracker's lead-console overlay was mounted, so the mission dot froze the
 * moment the lead left that modal. This hook streams the same telemetry while
 * the Mission tab (the screen a lead actually keeps open) is mounted.
 *
 * Module-level guard: at most ONE watcher per app instance — if the lead opens
 * the console overlay (which runs its own watcher) the duplicate rows are
 * harmless (append-only telemetry), but two instances of THIS hook (tab
 * remounts) never stack.
 *
 * B-89 MG-03 — the LM-C5 "native half" is now real: while this hook is
 * active it holds the mission FOREGROUND SERVICE (persistent "Mission
 * tracking active" notification), which keeps the process at foreground
 * priority so this watcher + heartbeat keep ticking with the screen off /
 * app backgrounded. Service stops when the mission leaves the active set
 * or the hook unmounts.

 * The client-no-show route proves the lead's presence from a recent
 * `mission_telemetry` row inside the pickup radius; it deliberately ignores any
 * position in the request body (a body fix would let a lead post the pickup
 * coordinates the app already holds and farm the cancellation fee from the
 * depot). The watcher only fires on movement or its 15 s heartbeat, and a lead
 * waiting at a pickup point is by definition stationary — so the report path
 * refreshes the row itself first.
 *
 * Resolves `true` only when a fix was obtained AND accepted, so the caller can
 * tell "no location" apart from "server refused".
