/**
 * useMissionAdvance — the ONE way the field app advances a mission's FSM.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from AssignedMissionDetailScreen, which used to be the only
 * caller of agentApi.missionPickup / missionGoLive / missionComplete anywhere in
 * the app. The driver's live tracker now renders the same contextual action (the
 * founder's "Client Picked Up" checkpoint), and two screens calling the same
 * transition is exactly how the deploy-checks translation, the session-loss
 * branch and the never-optimistic re-read drift apart.
 *
 * Everything here is behaviour that already existed and is load-bearing:
 *   - a best-effort device fix rides along so the server can geofence-WARN ops
 *     (LM-C3) — it never blocks, a denied permission resolves undefined;
 *   - `deploy_checks_incomplete` is translated into a plain sentence rather than
 *     surfacing a raw server code;
 *   - a genuine session loss (B-76, single-device takeover) signs out cleanly
 *     instead of reading as "could not advance";
 *   - truth is ALWAYS re-read from the server, including on the error path, so a
 *     lost-200 reconciles immediately instead of waiting for the next poll.
