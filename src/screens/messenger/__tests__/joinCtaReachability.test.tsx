/**
 * Scope v2 Phase 3 — "can the applicant actually SEE the way in, and does
 * pressing it DO anything?"
 *
 * This is a RENDER test on purpose, and it exists because a source scan failed
 * to see the same defect three times running:
 *
 *  - R5-1: both entry CTAs rendered inside `if (!entitled)`, while the only
 *    screen that navigates here (GroupsScreen) navigated only when
 *    `hasDeptChannels` was TRUE. Arriving required true, rendering required
 *    false. A scan for the helper name passed the whole time.
 *  - R6-1: the entitled-branch CTA was then placed inside the
 *    `channels.length > 0` list branch. A tier-only Enterprise individual holds
 *    no membership rows, so they land in the EMPTY branch — permanently.
 *  - R7 (found against the first version of THIS file): hiding the CTA behind
 *    `!inDepartmentalShell` left 26/26 green, because the test mounted ONE
 *    fixed navigator shape in which `isInDepartmentalShell` was always false.
 *    A reachability test that pins a single topology is not a reachability
 *    test — every Agent/CPO-shell user reaches this screen through the
 *    departmental shell, which is exactly the host R6-2 was about.
 *
 * So: every persona case runs under BOTH topologies, and the CTA is pressed,
 * because visibility is not function.
