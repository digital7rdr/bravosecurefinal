/**
 * Static source-scan guard for Issues 18 and 19 (Testing Issues V2, pp.23–24) —
 * "Departmental Chat Entry Card Does Not Open" and "Attendance and Incidents
 * Entry Does Not Open Across Dashboards".
 *
 * HISTORY — read this before "simplifying" the assertions below.
 *
 * The first pass on these two issues could not reproduce either symptom from
 * source and said so honestly: it removed the `as never` casts (which switch
 * route-name checking OFF) and pinned every target as registered, but left the
 * cause open pending a device repro.
 *
 * The cause was in source after all, and the casts were hiding it. GroupsScreen
 * is registered in TWO shells — MessengerNavigator AND AgentNavigator — but
 * `DepartmentChannels` is registered in MessengerNavigator ONLY. MainNavigator
 * renders exactly one shell at a time, so for a service-provider account in the
 * Agent shell there was no such route anywhere in the mounted tree: the
 * navigate found no target, bubbled to the root and was DROPPED. Silent in a
 * release build. It typechecked because the screen types its navigation as
 * `MessengerStackParamList` at BOTH mount points — TS validated the route
 * against a param list only one of the two shells implements.
 *
 * The fix is the shared resolver in `src/navigation/departmentalEntry.ts`,
 * whose behaviour (per shell, per role) is covered by
 * `src/navigation/__tests__/departmentalEntry.test.ts`. This file's remaining
 * job is to keep the call sites honest: no screen hosted by more than one
 * navigator may hard-code a shell-specific route name again.
