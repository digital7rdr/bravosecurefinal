  // BS-CALL-DUPMIC — this used to open a SECOND microphone.
  //
  // The removed implementation ran `expo-av Audio.Recording` (LOW_QUALITY +
  // metering) for the whole connected leg of every VOICE call and polled
  // `getStatusAsync().metering` at 10 Hz, purely to animate these 11 bars. Its
  // own comment said so ("opening a SECOND Audio.Recording on top of the WebRTC
  // mic capture") — it was throttled for BATTERY and never recognised as an
  // audio-correctness fault. It is one:
  //
  //   • Android — a second AudioRecord client with a DIFFERENT audio source
  //     (the preset's default, not VOICE_COMMUNICATION) forces audio policy to
  //     re-pick the input path. The HAL binds its AEC/NS preprocessing per
  //     input stream (`/vendor/etc/audio_effects.xml`, `<preprocess><stream
  //     type="voice_communication">`), so the reshuffle can drop echo
  //     cancellation off the call's capture — the far end then hears itself.
  //     It also re-tunes mic gain mid-call ("voice too quiet", "unstable
  //     volume").
  //   • iOS — `setAudioModeAsync({allowsRecordingIOS: true})` rewrites the
  //     AVAudioSession category underneath CallKit/RTCAudioSession, and expo-av
  //     never restores it; sqa.md already records the aftermath ("AVAudioSession
  //     stays in playAndRecord — subsequent playback routes quiet/earpiece until
  //     restart"). Starting a recorder on a live VoiceProcessingIO session also
  //     tears down the voice-processing (AEC) unit.
  //   • It re-ran on EVERY mute toggle and every background→foreground trip
  //     (both are in the dep list), so it churned the input on exactly the
  //     transitions the user notices.
  //
  // The engine already measures this level for us. `liveCall.stats.micLevel`
  // comes off the 1 Hz `getStats()` poll that useCall was already running
  // (`media-source`/`outbound-rtp` audioLevel), so the waveform keeps its 10 Hz
  // motion with ZERO extra capture and zero extra native calls — the tick below
  // is pure JS reading a ref.
  //
  // Do NOT reintroduce a recorder here. If the bars need to be livelier, raise

            BS-021: when the peer flips their camera off, the RN-WebRTC
            SurfaceView keeps painting the LAST decoded frame because
            RTP just stops — there's no tear-down signal at the native

            `call.media-state` advisory and swap in a placeholder so
            the receiver can tell intentional disable from a frozen
            connection. The remote stream stays attached (audio keeps
            flowing); only the video tile renders the placeholder.
            Audit CALL-N2 (2026-07-02) still governs the peer branch: it
            only mounts an RTCView when the remote actually HAS a live
            video track and hasn't toggled it off, because an audio-only
            remote stream still yields a valid streamURL and used to
            mount a full-screen BLACK SurfaceView. That decision lives in
            resolveRemoteTile and is reached through renderRemoteTile in
            BOTH slots — a swap never bypasses the gate. */}

              `overflow:hidden` to clip it — which works for ordinary views

              (WebRTCView.java:145/160) composited in its own layer, so the

              its corners still fill the small area between the rounded inner
              edge and the square content box. That is a nick inside the
