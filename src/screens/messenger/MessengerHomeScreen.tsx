          Calls/News render their body inline below; Files/Channels leave via the
          footer. The MessengerTabBar after this block stays mounted for all.

          ⚠️ B-655 — DO NOT re-introduce a `display:'none'` tab pane here.
          The 2026-08-24 "perf spine" mounted Chats and Calls permanently and
          toggled `display`, to avoid re-paying each tab's mount. It made the
          lag WORSE, for three measured-mechanism reasons:

            1. `display` is a YOGA property. React does not know about it — the
               hidden subtree still renders, still reconciles, and still holds
               every store subscription it declares. So `CallsLogBody`'s
               subscriptions ran on every store commit forever, including while
               the user was on Chats.
            2. Yoga SKIPS layout for a `display:'none'` subtree entirely
               (`YogaLayoutableShadowNode.cpp:729-732`), so flipping back to
               `flex:1` dirties the WHOLE subtree at once — one full layout +
               draw pass on the UI THREAD, at tap time. That is B-279's
               measured "Slow UI thread" bucket, and it is what made the tap
               itself feel slow.
            3. With no conditional, `setActiveTab` re-renders BOTH panes
               synchronously, where the conditional previously rendered `false`
               for the whole inactive one.

          The mount this conditional re-pays is now cheap because the calls log
          is virtualised (see CallsLogScreen's FlatList) — that pairing is the
          actual fix, and neither half works alone. Full audit:

   * UI corrections 2026-08-15 item 12 — "The buttons at the top right of the
   * screen is cut off."
   *
   * `headerTop` is `space-between` with two children and NEITHER could shrink:
   * this row had no `flex`, so it took its full intrinsic width (34dp avatar +
   * 10 + 32 mark + 10 + "MESSENGER" at 18px with letterSpacing 1.6 + the tier
   * chip), and `headerActions` was pushed past the right edge. space-between
   * cannot help once the children already overflow — it distributes slack, and
   * there is none.
   *
   * `flex: 1` lets this side yield; `minWidth: 0` is what actually permits the
   * shrink, because a flex child's default `min-width: auto` floors it at its
   * content size and would keep the overflow. Both are required — this is the
   * §3.2 "minWidth:0 on flex children that hold text" rule in DESIGN_REVIEW_LOOP.
   *
   * NOTE both header branches (normal and batch-select) share these style
   * objects, so this is one fix for both — the batch branch is the narrower
   * case, with three action pills.
