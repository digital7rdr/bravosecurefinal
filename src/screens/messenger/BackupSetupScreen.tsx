/**
 * BackupSetupScreen — dual-mode chat backup screen.
 *
 * Mode is auto-detected on mount via GET /backup/identity/header:
 *
 *   • SETUP mode (no server backup):
 *       Two password inputs (new + confirm). Submit → setupBackup()
 *       wraps + uploads + mirrors existing history.
 *
 *   • UNLOCK mode (server already has a backup row for this user):
 *       Single password input ("Enter your existing backup password").
 *       Submit → restoreBackup() unwraps the identity, then
 *       restoreAllMessages pulls every mirrored row back into the
 *       local store. Same flow that BackupRestoreScreen runs after a
 *       fresh install — but here we don't gate the runtime, because
 *       the user is already inside the app with a working session;
 *       restoring just re-syncs anything they may have missed.
 *
 *   This way the user can enter Settings → Chat Backup at any time
 *   without losing data: if they had a backup, we never overwrite it;
 *   we offer to unlock + pull everything.
 *
 * Reachable from MessengerSettings → Chat Backup, OR via the
 * SUGGEST branch in backupBoot when the user has chats but no backup.
