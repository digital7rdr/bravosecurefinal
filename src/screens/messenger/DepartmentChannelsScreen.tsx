 * B-869 (founder, 2026-09-12) — "click create a new account, it's just basic
 * plan. It shows CHANNEL instead of WORKSPACE. So make that change: channel,
 * instead put workspace."
 *
 * CONDITIONAL, not a blanket rename. An account with no organisation cannot
 * have channels, so for it this screen is entirely a workspace gate and
 * "Team threads · unread counts" is simply untrue — there are no teams and no
 * threads. Inside a real workspace the same screen IS the channel directory:
 * it is the shell's Channels TAB (`DepartmentalNavigator`), it lists channels,
 * it carries a Channels stat chip and a Manage Channels button, and the
 * workspace dashboard beside it is titled "Channels" too (client review vs2
 * item 17, pinned). Renaming that state would put the header out of step with
 * its own tab bar and with that pin, and would name a list of channels after
 * something it is not.
 *
 * The switch is `isOrgAffiliated` — the flag that already means "actually in an
 * org" here, as opposed to `hasDeptChannels`, which a paid tier alone satisfies.

 * dispatches a GO_BACK that bubbles to the tab router and reads as "the app
 * moved on its own". It is still a real back on the pushed path (from
 * MessengerHome), so the affordance is gated rather than removed.
 *
 * Note this screen renders its own header instead of ObHeader, so it does NOT
 * inherit ObHeader's BB-7 double-tap guard — another reason not to leave a
