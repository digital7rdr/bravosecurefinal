 * Every field of `CallLog` is WebRTC-derived — `conversationId`, `peerId`,
 * `outcome`, `duration` — and an emergency call has NONE of them: it is a
 * `tel:` hand-off to the OS, which reports nothing back. Bolting an
 * `isEmergency?: boolean` onto `CallLog` would have left five fields that are
 * structurally meaningless for half the rows, and — the part that actually
 * bites — the row tap calls `launchCall({conversationId})`, which for an
 * emergency row would resolve no peer and silently do nothing.
 *
 * The union makes both problems unrepresentable: an emergency row simply has
 * no `conversationId` to pass, so the tap MUST be written separately, and TS
 * refuses any code that reads a WebRTC field off one.
 *
 * NO OUTCOME IS INVENTED. There is no duration, no answered/missed. The OS
 * never tells us, and a guessed value would look exactly like a measured one
 * in a log people consult after an incident.

 *
 * `getDeviceCountryIso()` reads the phone's LOCALE — `I18nManager.localeIdentifier`
 * / `AppleLocale`, falling back to `Intl`. It is offline and has **nothing to do
 * with where the user actually is**. So a person in Bangladesh holding an
 * `en_US` phone would be shown "United States" and offered **911**.
 *
 * The first fix for this was to drop the country name. Review showed that makes
 * it WORSE: strip the label and the same person sees "tap a number to call" over
 * a 911 chip with nothing saying whose 911 it is — the wrong guess is hidden
 * instead of visible and correctable. So the card **names the country, says
 * where that came from, and offers a way out**: the whole header row opens the
 * full searchable directory, which already accepts a country.
 *
 * ── 2026-08-24, founder call: the CHEVRON-ONLY banner after all. ──────────
 * The v1 of this card argued one-tap chips beat a two-tap directory in an
 * emergency and shipped quick-dial chips. The founder, having both designs on
 * a device, chose the banner ("exact like this"): one calm affordance whose
 * single job is opening the full directory — where the location-pinned country
 * card dials in one further tap, with the country VISIBLE at dial time (the
 * chips dialled a locale-guessed country's number with the guess hidden by
 * brevity). `emergencyQuickDialChips` stays exported: the directory's country
 * cards use the same merge/emphasis rules.
