/**
 * IncomingGroupCallScreen — full-screen ring UI for inbound group calls.
 *
 * Mounted by the navigation root when the runtime receives a
 * `sfu.ring.incoming` frame. Plays the device default ringtone +
 * vibrates, shows the caller (group) name and an Accept / Decline pair.
 *
 *   Accept  → navigate to GroupCallScreen with direction='incoming' so
 *             useGroupCall joins the room without firing another ring.
 *   Decline → fire `sfu.ring.decline` so the host's UI can show the
 *             decline + close this screen.
 *
 * Subscribes to the same multi-listener ring dispatcher so it can
 * self-dismiss when the host cancels (`sfu.ring.cancelled`).
