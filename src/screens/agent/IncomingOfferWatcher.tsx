/**
 * IncomingOfferWatcher (BUILD_RUNBOOK Step 20) — the agency-wide "interrupt from any screen"
 * driver. The FCM dispatch wake is intentionally opaque (and not yet routed client-side), so
 * the robust path is to POLL `GET /dispatch/offers/current` while the agency app is
 * foregrounded; when a fresh offer surfaces, deep-link into the full-screen IncomingOffer
 * interrupt via navigationRef (AgentNavigator is the active navigator, so the route resolves).
 *
 * Renders nothing. Self-disables for non-agency callers: GET /dispatch/offers/current is
 * OrgManagerGuard-gated, so a 401/403 means "not a company agency" → stop polling (no noise).
 * Mounted once in AgentNavigator so it covers every agency screen.
