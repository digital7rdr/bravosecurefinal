/**
 * THE MANAGER ACCESS CONTRACT (founder-specified):
 *   "what module a manager can access, the owner decides. If the owner doesn't
 *    choose any then he will not have any module. And all the modules will have
 *    the same access as the owner."
 *
 * Two things had to be true for that, and neither was.
 *
 * 1. THE DISCRIMINATOR. Every client-side attempt to answer "is this account a
 *    delegated manager?" has been wrong, and each wrong answer was invisible
 *    because it was wrong in the safe direction (false → no filter).
 *      B-215 before: `account_kind === 'cpo' && is_org_manager`  — never true.
 *      B-215 after:  `account_kind === 'agency' && !!org`        — never true.
 *    Verified against production, both accounts of the reported org:
 *      owner  "Agent Due" → {account_kind:'agency', org: null}
 *      mgr    "CPO 1"     → {account_kind:'cpo',    org: 'Agent Due'}
 *    The second test is false for BOTH: a manager is a PROMOTED CPO, so
 *    `agents.managed_by_org_id` is set and ACCOUNT_KIND_SQL's deliberate cpo
 *    precedence pins account_kind='cpo'. Hence a server-computed `managed_org`,
 *    read straight off the org_members manager row. `is_org_manager` cannot
 *    serve — it is true for the owner too (that was B-210).
 *
 * 2. THE GRANT RULE. `permitted_modules` DEFAULTS to NULL, and one nullable
 *    column was carrying two questions — "is this a manager?" and "what were
 *    they granted?". Whichever way NULL was read, one of them broke:
 *      NULL→[]   (pre-f0d3a98) locked every unconfigured manager down;
 *      NULL kept (f0d3a98)     made "granted nothing" mean "granted everything".
 *    Splitting the questions settles it: `managed_org` answers the first, so
 *    NULL and [] can both mean the one thing the founder asked for — nothing.
 *
 * The old ALWAYS_VISIBLE_KEYS baseline (msg/intel/region) is GONE, so those
 * three are now grantable instead of hardcoded — see the invariant at the
 * bottom, which is what stops "not grantable" from ever becoming a dead end.
