/**
 * Agent Live Tracker Screen
 *
 * Map-first companion to MissionLeadConsoleScreen. The agent is
 * moving — chrome is minimal, the map and incoming comms are the
 * entire surface.
 *
 *   • Mapbox WebView (bravoAgentTrackerMapHtml) renders pickup,
 *     dropoff, route polyline, the agent's CPO marker (with heading
 *     cone + ripple ring) and the principal marker.
 *   • On-map speech bubbles render every new mission-group message
 *     directly above the sender's marker — fade in 200ms, hold 6s,
 *     fade out 180ms. Stack max 2; older bubbles collapse into a +N
 *     chip. System events render as square info-blue bubbles
 *     anchored to waypoints (not markers).
 *   • Mini-status strip auto-updates as waypoints fire / ETA changes
 *     so the agent always sees the latest event without scanning chat.
 *   • Message dock: typed text SENDS directly into the mission Ops Room
 *     (runtime.sendText, same encryption/receipts model ChatScreen uses —
 *     B-212, previously this just navigated to Chat with the text prefilled,
 *     requiring a second manual send). Call buttons launch the group SFU
 *     call directly too, via the app-root navigationRef so it works from
 *     every mode's nested stack. Tapping a bubble/chip (not the dock) still
 *     opens the full Chat screen to read history (mission.comms_channel_id).
 *   • Right-edge slide handle opens the legacy MissionLeadConsole
 *     (with manual mark buttons) as a horizontal slide-in panel —
 *     swipe right or tap the close button to dismiss.
 *   • Mission complete → MissionSummary screen handles the post-mortem.
 *
 * Backend feed: polls agentApi.getMissionDeployment every 4s. The
 * waypoint list, coordinates, and short-code are the source of truth.
