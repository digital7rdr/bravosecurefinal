/**
 * Founder 2026-08-08 — "remove Operator Partner completely from Virtual
 * Bodyguard."
 *
 * VBG is a PERSONAL safety product; there is no roster of officers to onboard
 * under a master licence, so the provider funnel has no business on that path.
 * It must still be offered everywhere else — it is how a security company signs
 * up (D-5), not a plan the client chooses between, so a blanket removal would
 * be a different and much worse bug.
 *
 * Asserted by CALLING `cardsForProduct`, not by scanning source. The sibling
 * scan in `screens/booking/__tests__/productScopedPlans.test.ts` can only see
 * that the guard is written; only this can see what the screen would render.
