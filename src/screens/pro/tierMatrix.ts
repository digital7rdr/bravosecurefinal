/**
 * F9 / PDF A2 + M2 — "the Professional plan must not appear in the Enterprise
 * onboarding route."
 *
 * `plansForProduct` is the ONBOARDING plan list and nothing else: its only
 * production caller is `RoleSelectionScreen.cardsForProduct`, the pre-auth
 * plan picker reached from the product cards. The Enterprise plan is sold on
 * the MESSENGER path (Department Channels is a tier of that ladder, see
 * PRODUCT_PLANS), so that path IS the Enterprise onboarding route, and the rule
 * lands here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MUST NOT TOUCH — the reason the filter is a selector and not an
 * edit to `PRODUCT_PLANS`:
 *
 *   - `src/screens/settings/PricingScreen.tsx` is Settings -> Pricing, where any
 *     user MANAGES their own plan. It reads TIER_LABELS / TIER_FEATURES, not
 *     this function. Filtering Professional out of that screen would strand
 *     every live Pro subscriber with no current-plan row and no downgrade path.
 *   - `TierPaywall` reads the same two maps, so an existing Pro purchase flow
 *     still resolves its label and features.
 *   - The SECURE path keeps "Bravo Secure Pro": that is the request-and-approval
 *     protection plan, a different product family (lockedTerminology.test.ts),
 *     not the Professional messenger tier A2 names.
 *
 * So `PRODUCT_PLANS` stays the full catalogue and only the onboarding VIEW of it
 * narrows.
