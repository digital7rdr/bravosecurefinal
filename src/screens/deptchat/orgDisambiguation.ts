/**
 * Channels vs2 edge A7 — TWO ORGANISATIONS WITH THE SAME NAME.
 *
 * The Workspace Hub tiles, the invite picker's stage 1, and Manage Channels'
 * stage 1 all render an organisation as its `name` and nothing else. Names
 * carry no uniqueness constraint anywhere — that fact is load-bearing elsewhere
 * (the Rev-7 security argument hinged on it) — so a person who belongs to two
 * organisations called "Acme" sees two identical rows and picks by coin flip.
 * On the hub that decides which company's data the whole Departmental surface
 * then reads and writes.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A PURE RULE AND NOT A RENDERER ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The review prescribed putting it in "the shared grouping helper so all three
 * surfaces get it at once". They do NOT share one: the hub reads
 * `user.workspaces` from the auth store, while the other two go through
 * `topLevelOf`. A helper in `organisationTree` would have covered two of the
 * three and looked finished.
 *
 * So the DECISION lives here, once, and each surface renders it in its own
 * idiom (the hub already has a role line, Manage Channels already has a channel
 * count). What must never be copied is the rule for WHEN to disambiguate.
 *
 * ── WHY ONLY ON A COLLISION ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Appending an id to every row would be noise on the overwhelmingly common
 * single-org case, and noise is how people stop reading a line that matters.
 */

/**
 * The display names that appear MORE THAN ONCE in this list.
 *
 * Trimmed and case-folded, because "Acme" and "acme " are the same name to the
 * person choosing between them — which is the entire failure being fixed.
 * Blank names collapse together too: they are indistinguishable by definition,
 * so they are exactly the case that needs the extra line.
