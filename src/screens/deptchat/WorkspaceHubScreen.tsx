/**
 * F-WSHUB — the workspace list page (Discord/Slack style, doc §6).
 *
 * Three existing calls compose the page — no new endpoint:
 *   1. "Your workspace"  — enterpriseApi.myWorkspace() when owns_workspace.
 *   2. "Member of"       — user.org when org_is_workspace and not their own
 *                          (the owner's org row has org.id === user.id).
 *   3. "Invitations"     — enterpriseApi.myInvites(): acceptable rows reuse
 *                          ApprovalStatusScreen's accept flow INCLUDING the
 *                          code:null fork (email invites carry no code);
 *                          blocked rows (B-413 workspace owners) render
 *                          informationally with the reason — never a CTA,
 *                          never a badge/count on any entry point.
 *   4. Empty state       — "Create a workspace" → the existing setup fork.
 *
 * ENTERING a workspace goes through the departmentalEntry resolver — a bare
 * navigate('Departmental') only lands on Home for a COLD mount (its :124-127
 * warning), and this screen is reached from more than one place.
 *
 * Under today's one-org rule the list holds at most one enterable workspace
 * plus invites; Phase B drops multi-entries into a page that already exists.

                    enter it once and never point the Departmental surface back
                    at their agency (sticky context, nothing clears it).

                    ⚠️ B-849 REWROTE HOW IT DOES THAT. It used to enter with a
                    NULL context — "primary-org mode" — and null does not mean
                    "no organisation", it meant EVERY organisation. It also
                    called whatever org it found "Your organisation": for a
                    LAPSED workspace owner the primary-org resolution falls
                    through to the first membership, so the card labelled an
                    EMPLOYER as the user's own company.

                    Now it sets a NAMED context (which is what MAJOR-3a
                    actually wanted — "point the surface back at their agency")
                    and the subtitle tells the truth: the owner line ONLY when
                    the org really is theirs (`org_workspaces` keys an org on
                    its owner, so their own org row has `org.id === user.id`),
                    otherwise the same role line the tiles use. The navigator's
                    A8 exemption is what keeps this context from being ejected,
                    since an agency org is never in `workspaces`.

                    ⚠️ F1 — `isEnterablePrimaryOrg`, NOT a bare `user.org`. Two
                    different things sit in `org` and not in `workspaces`: an
                    AGENCY (no `org_workspaces` row to join — enterable, and the
                    whole point of this card) and a LAPSED WORKSPACE (dropped
                    out of the lapse-gated array while `org` keeps naming it —
                    NOT enterable, founder Q1). Without the predicate this card
                    offered an employee a door into a company whose every scoped
                    read comes back empty, one row under the "Subscription
