/**
 * A5 — Create Org Workspace.
 *
 * ── WHAT CREATING A WORKSPACE DOES *NOT* DO ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not make the owner a service provider. The only pre-existing way to
 * own an org was the agency funnel (`POST /agents` type='company'), which flips
 * `users.role` to service_provider and routes the account into the provider home
 * and the job marketplace. An Enterprise company running internal department
 * channels is not a security-services agency, so `POST /org/workspace` mints an
 * owner without that role grant (owner-decided 2026-08-04).
 *
 * The consequence the server carries for us: the owner stays
 * `account_kind: 'individual'`, and it is `owns_workspace` — not the account
 * kind — that makes them org-affiliated. Nothing on this screen needs to know
 * that, but a future edit that "helpfully" also created an agent would silently
 * move the user into the wrong product.
