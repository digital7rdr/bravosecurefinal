/**
 * Item H — incident report drafts (M10: "draft saving").
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SAFE, stated up front because this repo bans message drafts:
 * the messenger drafts ban (draftsPersistence.test.ts / the messengerStore
 * partialize whitelist) exists because MESSAGE plaintext must never leave
 * SQLCipher. An incident report is a different confidentiality class — its
 * description is sent to the server AS PLAINTEXT on submit (incidentApi.submit
 * body), so a local draft adds no new exposure. Media is stored as URIs ONLY —
 * never bytes, never base64 (the host-activity-reclaim lesson on the details
 * screen) — pointing at the user's own camera roll / cache files.
 *
 * Keyed per user (the backupFlags pattern): a shared device must not leak one
 * account's half-written report into another's compose screen. Drafts are
 * ALSO swept on logout (authStore) — the text can name people and events, and
 * must not outlive the account.
 *
 * ONE slot per user, last-writer-wins BY DESIGN: starting a fresh report
 * overwrites any older draft on the first edit. Saves are whole-object
 * (category+severity+content together), so a hybrid of two reports can never
 * exist — the trade-off is silent replacement, accepted for v1.

   * draft cannot tell a capture (delete on discard, re-probe on restore — the
