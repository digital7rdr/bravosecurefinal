/**
 * Incident photo evidence (Dept Chat v2 · Step 10 · E3/E4) — client orchestration
 * that REUSES the runtime seal seam (E1) + the incident key store (E2). No crypto
 * is implemented here; we only call the exposed runtime methods + the API.
 *
 * SUBMIT: encrypt+upload the photo, seal its per-file key to each recipient
 * (manager + submitter) device, attach the pointer, store the sealed blobs, grant
 * download access. VIEW: fetch this device's sealed blob, unseal it, download +
 * decrypt the ciphertext, write a temp file to render.
 *
 * The photo is read from its file:// / content:// uri at upload time (NOT held as
 * a base64 string in screen state) — a multi-MB base64 in React state was enough
 * to get the host activity reclaimed under memory pressure on low-RAM devices,
 * which "refreshed" the in-progress report.
 *
 * v1 seals to / fetches from the PRIMARY device (Signal default deviceId 1) — the
 * same device id chat addresses every peer with. Real multi-device fan-out is E5.
 *
 * Diagnostics: every failure surfaces a `reason` to the caller AND logs a
 * non-secret `[bravo.incident-evidence]` breadcrumb (step + counts + error name
 * only — never a key, iv, body, or coordinate) so a device test can pinpoint
 * where the pipeline stops.
