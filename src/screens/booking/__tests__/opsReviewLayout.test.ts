/**
 * Developer feedback, August 2026 — screen 01 of 19 ("Approval and
 * cancellation layout"), founder's annotated device screenshots.
 *
 * Three corrections were required on OpsRoomReviewScreen:
 *
 *   1. "Avoid duplicating the same waiting status in multiple large panels."
 *      The screen told the SAME pending status four times: the nav pill, the
 *      hourglass hero, a decorative Pending|Approved|Rejected tri-state row,
 *      and a locked "WAITING FOR BRAVO CONTROL SYSTEM" footer bar. Only the
 *      first two survive — the pill (compact) and the hero (the one panel).
 *
 *   2. "Move the cancellation action to a consistent, easy-to-find position
 *      near the booking controls." CANCEL REQUEST was buried at the bottom of
 *      the status hero, so it moved with the hero's content. It now lives in
 *      the fixed bottom controls slot, below the ScrollView.
 *
 *   3. "Keep the pending approval status clear." Handwritten on the shot:
 *      "last screen chance to cancel request — after this no more cancel".
 *      That expectation is now stated in the UI instead of being folklore.
 *
 * A fourth defect fell out of the rework: dismissing the auto-pay sheet on an
 * APPROVED booking dropped the user back onto a bar reading "WAITING FOR
 * BRAVO CONTROL SYSTEM" — i.e. the screen claimed the booking was still
 * un-reviewed when ops had already approved it. The approved state now offers
 * the real next action.
 *
 * Source scan (the navigatorConfig idiom): rendering this screen would pull
 * the whole booking tree into Jest. Comments are stripped line-wise and the
 * file is read CRLF-normalised — both are CLAUDE.md scan traps.
