/**
 * Locked product + operations terminology (Testing Issues V2, PDF p.5, and
 * Issues 23 / 33 / 35).
 *
 *   Client-facing operations term  ->  "Bravo Control System"
 *     BANNED in client copy: "Ops Room", "Control Room", "Ops Room Review",
 *     "Awaiting Ops Approval", "Ops Room Notified".
 *   Secure Services plans          ->  "Bravo Secure" / "Bravo Secure Pro" (no "Lite", founder 2026-09-02)
 *     BANNED: bare "Bravo Pro" — it does not say which BRAVO family it is.
 *   A registered security company  ->  "Service Provider"
 *     BANNED here: "Enterprise", which is reserved for corporate /
 *     Department Chat account contexts.
 *
 * SCOPE — client-facing screens only. The PDF says internal console labels are
 * "separately reviewed", and CPO/agent surfaces are operator-facing. In
 * particular AssignedMissionDetailScreen's "Open Ops Room" names the mission
 * CHAT ROOM, not the operations team, so renaming it to "Bravo Control System"
 * would be actively wrong. Those are listed in OPERATOR_FACING below with the
 * reason, so the omission is a decision on the record rather than an oversight.
