/**
 * Static source-scan regression for Issue 11 (Testing Issues V2, PDF p.16) —
 * "Mission Group Messaging Fails Between Mobile App and Bravo Control System".
 * CRITICAL.
 *
 * DIAGNOSED: org-mission.service.assignCrew creates the mission (step 3) and
 * THEN opens the Ops Room (step 5) inside a try/catch that logged at WARN and
 * carried on. When that catch fired the mission was already inserted AND
 * DISPATCHED, so crew-assign reported success while the mission had no comms
 * room — the mobile mission chat had nothing to open and the console answered
 * `conversation_not_found_or_forbidden`. Exactly the reported symptom, and
 * invisible until a human noticed mid-mission.
 *
 * NOW FIXED IN FULL, in two halves:
 *   1. the failure is no longer silent — ERROR level plus a queryable
 *      `missions.comms_room_failed_at` marker;
 *   2. the PDF's "mission activation must fail safely if the communication room
 *      cannot be created" — a FRESH assign whose room cannot be opened is
 *      ROLLED BACK (mission ABORTED, crew stood down, arrival clock cleared)
 *      and the assign fails with `comms_room_unavailable`, so a mission is
 *      never dispatched to a crew nobody can reach. A RESUME is deliberately
 *      NOT rolled back — that mission predates the call and may be in flight.
 *
 * The per-branch behaviour (which SQL runs, which pushes are suppressed, the
 * PICKUP race, a rollback that itself fails) is covered by the real unit tests
 * in `apps/auth-service/src/org/org-mission.service.spec.ts`. This file guards
 * the invariants that no unit test can see from the mobile project.
 *
 * This area has regressed five times (B-207, B-210, B-211, B-216) — B-210 being
 * a CRITICAL self-inflicted one that silently blocked the intent drain on every
 * trigger. Diagnosis before code.
