/**
 * One place that answers "did this fail because the wallet was short on Bravo
 * Credits, and by how much?" — Issue 25 (Testing Issues V2, PDF p.30).
 *
 * Why this exists: the same question was answered four different ways and three
 * of them were wrong for at least one caller.
 *
 *   - bookingStore pre-check  throws `Error & {code, amountDue}` BEFORE the
 *     request, so the code survives on the error itself.
 *   - the server throws `BadRequestException` whose body is `{code, message,
 *     required, balance}` — but bookingStore.confirmBooking's catch used to
 *     flatten it into a bare `new Error(friendly)`, so by the time a screen saw
 *     it only `.message` was left.
 *   - NestJS's validation pipe returns `message` as a string[], not a string.
 *
 * So a caller can be handed any of: the typed local error, a live axios error
 * with a structured body, or a flattened Error carrying only the raw code in
 * its message. All three mean the same thing and all three must route the user
 * to the top-up paywall instead of an alert that leaks `insufficient_credits`.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free (no axios, no RN) so the node `booking` Jest
 * project can unit-test it directly rather than scanning source.
