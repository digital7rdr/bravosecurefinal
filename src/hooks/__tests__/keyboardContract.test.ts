/**
 * sqa.md bug register — this suite pins: B-204.
 *
 * B-204 (the composer did not sit flush above the keyboard — device-verified on the
 * founder's Redmi phone in v1.0.132) is a consequence of the app-wide rule this contract
 * scan enforces: the bottom-most element of a surface owns the keyboard inset and pads by
 * bottomPad(gap), which REPLACES the safe-area inset rather than stacking on it. The bans
 * here (KeyboardAvoidingView, keyboardVerticalOffset, Keyboard.addListener outside the rule
 * module, a kbHeight variable, behavior=Platform.OS===ios?padding:undefined) are what keep
 * a hand-rolled formula from reintroducing it.
 */
/**
 * B-184 — the keyboard-inset CONTRACT, enforced by source scan.
 *
 * The unit suite (`useKeyboardLayout.test.tsx`) proves the arithmetic. This
 * suite proves the arithmetic is the ONLY one in the app: no screen may
 * hand-roll keyboard avoidance again, because every previous attempt to fix
 * "the keyboard covers my input" produced a NEW per-screen formula and the
 * formulas disagreed — B-84 fixed 17 screens with three different idioms and
 * the founder still hit blind space on iOS and a cut-off composer on Android.
 *
 * Why a source scan and not a render test: these screens import native modules
 * (op-sqlite, WebRTC, callkeep) that the node Jest project cannot load, so
 * there is no way to mount them. The scan is the gate.
 *
 * Scanning rules this file obeys (CLAUDE.md, learned the hard way):
 *   • Comments are STRIPPED before any absence assertion — prose naming a
 *     banned symbol is the most common false result in this repo.
 *   • Sources are CRLF. Never anchor on a bare \n.
 *
 * If one of these ever needs to change, change it DELIBERATELY with the
 * reason in the diff — do not delete an assertion to make a red run green.
