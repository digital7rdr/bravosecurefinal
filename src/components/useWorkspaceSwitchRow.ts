/**
 * The Workspaces / Channels row that sits at the bottom of SWITCH DASHBOARD.
 *
 * Extracted so the drawer and the Profile screen render the SAME row rather
 * than two hand-written copies. ProfileDrawerModal already carried a warning
 * that the row is drawn twice and that the copies must be kept in step; adding
 * a third renderer on Profile without a shared source would have made that a
 * guarantee of drift instead of a risk. Its label, pill and destination all
 * depend on affiliation, which is exactly the part that must not fork.
 *
 * `dismiss` exists because the two hosts leave differently: the drawer is a
 * modal that must animate out BEFORE the navigate (220ms, matching its own
 * close), while the Profile screen is already a full screen and navigates
 * immediately. Passing the host's exit in keeps that difference at the call
 * site instead of duplicating the destination logic to accommodate it.
