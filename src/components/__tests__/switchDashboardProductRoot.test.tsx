/**
 * B-393 — the SWITCH DASHBOARD row for the product you are ALREADY in was a
 * silent no-op.
 *
 * `switchProduct` only writes `activeProduct`, and MainNavigator keys the whole
 * client tab tree on that value. Re-selecting the same product therefore wrote
 * the value it already held: no remount, so `SecureTab`'s `initialParams` never
 * re-applied, and the drawer simply closed on the screen the user was already
 * looking at. Founder repro: Secure Services → drawer → "Secure Services"
 * (marked CURRENT) → still the "Book Close Protection" booking hero, never the
 * product root.
 *
 * B-390 fixed where a real product SWITCH lands. This pins the same landing rule
 * for the non-switch, and it is asserted by RENDERING the control and pressing
 * the row — the previous pin was a source scan of MainNavigator, which cannot
 * see that the drawer never reaches MainNavigator's decision at all.
 *
 * PDF-1 #1 update: the secure product root is now the tier resolver
 * `SecureLanding` (PRO→ProDashboard, LITE→the Wave 5d 4-tab shell `SecureShell`),
 * not the `SecureServices` plan chooser. The drawer's same-product tap must name
 * that new root, in lock step with MainNavigator's initialParams. The truncation
 * guard keys on the concrete tier home — `ProDashboard` for PRO, `SecureShell`
 * for LITE — which is the route the resolver actually seeds.
