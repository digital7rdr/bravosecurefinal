/**
 * ImageryBackdrop — the atmospheric brand photo that sits BEHIND card content.
 *
 * The design direction (founder mocks 2026-08-01, client request 2026-08-25) is
 * photographic imagery fading into the obsidian surface, never a photo the user
 * reads content off. That distinction is the whole component:
 *
 *   1. The photo is DECORATIVE. It is hidden from screen readers and never
 *      receives touches — the card underneath keeps its own role/label.
 *   2. The scrim is NOT cosmetic. Card copy is white/dim-white on `#0A1F3F`;
 *      dropping a photo behind it without a floor would sink contrast under the
 *      4.5:1 WCAG AA body-text bar that DESIGN_REVIEW_LOOP §3.4 treats as an
 *      automatic Major. Every variant therefore pins a MINIMUM obsidian alpha
 *      across the region where text actually sits, and `imageryBackdrop.test.ts`
 *      asserts those floors so a future "let's make it brighter" pass has to
 *      argue with a red test rather than silently ship unreadable cards.
 *
 * Perf note: this repo's lag work (CLAUDE.md, B-279/B-285) measured every jank
 * bucket as *Slow UI thread*, with the GPU idle at 3-7ms against a 16.7ms
 * budget. Extra gradient overdraw is therefore cheap here; extra VIEWS and
 * image DECODES are not. So each variant renders exactly one `Image` + one
 * `LinearGradient`, the component is memoised, and Android's cross-fade is
 * disabled (`fadeDuration={0}`) to avoid an extra commit per card.

  //
  // This is the one arrangement where the scrim's whole justification is
  // absent. Every other variant puts copy ON the photo, so its alpha floor is
  // what keeps that copy above 4.5:1. Here the photo lives in its own fixed
  // band and the title/description sit in a SIBLING view below it, on the flat
  // card surface — no text ever crosses the image, so a contrast floor over it
  // would be protecting nothing while costing the photograph.
  //
  // Hence `imageOpacity: 1` and a gradient that is fully CLEAR across the top
  // 62%. The tail is NOT dimming and must not be removed: the band has no
  // border of its own, so without it the photo ends on a hard horizontal cut
  // against the card body. It ramps only inside the bottom third, which is the
  // blend, not a scrim.
  //
  // `minTextAlpha: 0` / `textStops: []` are the honest encoding of "no copy
  // here". They are not an exemption to reuse — `imageryBackdrop.test.tsx`
  // pins the CALL SITES of this variant precisely so that putting text over a
