/**
 * ImageryBackdrop pins (client beautification pass, 2026-08-25).
 *
 * The backdrop puts a photograph behind card copy. Two properties are
 * load-bearing and neither is visible in a screenshot review:
 *
 *   * CONTRAST — card text is white / dim-white on obsidian `#07090D`. The
 *     scrim's job is to hold the effective background dark enough that body
 *     copy stays above the 4.5:1 WCAG AA bar (DESIGN_REVIEW_LOOP §3.4 makes a
 *     contrast miss an automatic Major). "Make the photo pop" is exactly the
 *     change that quietly breaks it, so the alpha floors are asserted here.
 *   * DECORATIVE — the photo carries no information the card's own
 *     accessibilityLabel does not, so it must be skipped by screen readers and
 *     must never swallow a touch meant for the card.
