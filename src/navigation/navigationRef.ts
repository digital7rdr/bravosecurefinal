 * search, so it lives here rather than becoming a second drifted copy.
 *
 * Relies on `routeNames` being REGISTRATION-complete (React Navigation lists
 * every registered screen whether or not it has rendered), so a lazy tab that
 * has never been opened is still found. What must be mounted is the navigator
 * that registers the route, not the screen itself — and a child navigator's
 * state is written into its parent's `routes[i].state` during the child's first
 * render, so any tree containing a live caller is already populated.

 * Is `route` sitting in the mounted tree with OTHER routes stacked ON TOP of it?

 * already exists — StackRouter returns `routes.slice(0, index + 1)`, dropping
 * everything above it. So landing on a root that is already in the stack is a
 * POP, and it destroys whatever the user has open above it. That is only safe
 * to do silently when there is nothing there: when the route is absent the same
 * navigate is an ordinary push, and when it is already the top it is a no-op.
 *
 * Concretely, `SecureProApplyScreen` keeps all fifteen application fields in
 * local `useState` with no store behind them and no `beforeRemove` guard, so a
 * pop past it is unrecoverable.
 *
 * Returns false when the ref is not ready — an unmounted tree has nothing to
 * destroy, and a guard that blocks on "I don't know" would block the first tap
 * after boot.
