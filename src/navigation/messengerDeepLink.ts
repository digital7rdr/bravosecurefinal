/**
 * B-257 / B-258 — where the messenger screens actually live, per shell.
 *
 * THE BUG. Every notification deep-link hard-coded ONE path:
 *
 *     navigate('Main', {screen: 'MessengerTab', params: {screen: 'CallScreen', …}})
 *
 * `MessengerTab` exists only in the CLIENT tab shell. `MainNavigator` mounts
 * exactly one shell per account kind and returns `<CpoNavigator/>` or
 * `<AgentNavigator/>` BEFORE it ever reaches those tabs, so for a CPO or an
 * agency account that route is not in the mounted tree at all. React Navigation
 * drops an unresolvable navigate silently, which left the user sitting on
 * whatever was on screen — in practice the product gate, "Choose Dashboard".
 *
 * For a message that is an annoyance. For a CALL it is the whole bug: the
 * accept runs inside CallScreen (`useCall` consumes the cached offer SDP and
 * answers). No CallScreen mounted → nobody ever answers → the caller rings out
 * and the call "fails or cuts". Answering from the notification was therefore
 * broken for every CPO and agency account.
 *
 * The routes were never missing — they are registered in all three shells, just
 * at three different paths:
 *
 *   | shell  | path to CallScreen                            |
 *   | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
 *   | client | Main -> MessengerTab -> CallScreen            |
 *   | agency | CallScreen              (AgentNavigator root) |
 *   | cpo    | CpoTabs -> CpoComms -> CallScreen             |
 *
 * This module is the ONE place that knows that table, and it decides the shell
 * with `resolveAuthedRoute` — the same pure function `MainNavigator` uses to
 * choose which shell to mount. Deriving it a second way is how the deep-link
 * and the shell would drift apart again.
 *
 * This is the third instance of one pattern in this codebase (see B-251 and
 * Issues 18/19): a hard-coded route name that only holds in one of several
 * mounted shells. If you are about to write a literal route name in code that
 * more than one shell can run, resolve it here instead.
