/**
 * Wave 5d (PDF-2 A7) — the Secure LITE 4-tab shell (Home · Book · Summary ·
 * Messenger).
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SCAN. SecureTabNavigator and its leaf screens pull the whole
 * booking/messenger tree (RN screens, native modules) that the node project
 * cannot import, so — like navigatorConfig / workspaceBottomNav — the shape is
 * locked at the source level: which tabs the bar renders, in which order, what
 * each maps to, that Messenger EXITS, and that the Pro landing is preserved while
 * the LITE landing is the shell. The reachability half (all ~55 booking routes
 * still resolve) is structural: the shell is a route INSIDE BookingNavigator, so
 * the negative pins below (no per-tab stack, drilling bubbles up) are what keep
 * it that way.
 *
 * Files may be CRLF — normalise first, and strip comments so the prose that
 * names every tab and route cannot satisfy a scan about CODE.
