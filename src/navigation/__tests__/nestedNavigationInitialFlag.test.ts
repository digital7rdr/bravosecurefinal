/**
 * R11-1 — `initial: false` on nested navigation, enforced repo-wide instead of
 * one literal pin per call site.
 *
 * THE RULE. React Navigation overrides a child navigator's `initialRouteName`
 * with the nested screen whenever `params.initial !== false`
 * (`@react-navigation/core` useNavigationBuilder). If that child is a STACK and
 * it has not mounted yet — which is the normal case, since tabs are lazy by
 * default — the stack initialises AT the target with no history beneath it.
 * Back falls out of the stack, and any control that later tries to reach the
 * stack's real root with a bare tab switch lands on the target instead, for the
 * life of the shell.
 *
 * WHY A SCAN. This bug was found three separate times in this phase (R9-2, then
 * R10-1 twice) and each fix was pinned with a literal assertion naming one call
 * site. Those pins do not see call site N+1 — and the two R10-1 fixes were
 * proven unpinned by a mutation that survived the FULL app project at an
 * identical total. Enumerating sites is what keeps failing; the rule is what
 * needs enforcing.
 *
 * Comments are stripped before any assertion: an `initial: false` mentioned in
 * prose must not satisfy the check, and — the way this test's own first draft
 * misread `DepartmentalHomeScreen` — a long comment BETWEEN `screen:` and
 * `initial:` must not hide a flag that is genuinely there.
