/**
 * R6-4 / R7-1 — the SIBLING search, which had no test at all.
 *
 * `findNavigatorWithRoute` walks the caller's ancestors. That is right for
 * "where may I go from here", but the client shell is a TAB navigator, so
 * SecureTab's routes and MessengerTab's routes are siblings — invisible to an
 * ancestor walk. Two separate dead taps came from exactly that:
 *
 *  - R6-4: `openPricing` dispatched Main → SecureTab → Pricing from the Agent
 *    and CPO shells, where SecureTab does not exist. The payload went unhandled
 *    and the upgrade button did nothing.
 *  - R7-1: the applicant's own "your request was approved" notification, tapped
 *    from the client shell's ActivityCenter (BookingNavigator, under SecureTab),
 *    could not reach the join screens registered under MessengerTab.
 *
 * The correctness of both now rests on one claim: `routeNames` is
 * REGISTRATION-complete, so a lazy tab that has never been rendered is still
 * found, and only the navigator that REGISTERS the route needs to be mounted.
 * If that were false the search would return false for a client-shell user who
 * should reach Pricing — a false negative worse than the original bug. So the
 * claim is pinned here rather than left as a comment.
