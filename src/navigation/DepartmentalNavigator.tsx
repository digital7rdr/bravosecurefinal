/**
 * DepartmentalNavigator (Dept Chat v2 — Step 19) — the dedicated "Departmental"
 * 5-tab module from the PDF Product Map (Home · Channels · Attend · Incident ·
 * Vault). ONE shell, opened by BOTH parties: a managed CPO/member (pushed from
 * CpoNavigator) and a service-provider company/manager (pushed from
 * AgentNavigator). Only each tab's ROOT screen differs by role; authorization is
 * still decided server-side — this only picks which already-guarded screen shows
 * first. Pushed as a FULL-SCREEN route so its own obsidian footer is the only
 * one on screen (no nested-tab double footer). Every feature screen (PDF p.4–15)
 * is reused verbatim from Steps 12–18 — nothing is rebuilt here.

// a CPO of one org but a manager of another resolved to account_kind='cpo' and
// was shown the member surface. Falls back to the account_kind heuristic for a
// session cached before /auth/me carried the flag. The branch only chooses each
// tab's first screen; the server guards still decide.
//
// Phase B — when the Workspace Hub set an explicit context, ITS role decides
// via the ONE shared predicate (contextManagerRole — see its guard-mirroring
// rationale): an owner browsing a workspace they joined must get the member
// UI, or their manager chrome would point at their OWN org's data inside the
