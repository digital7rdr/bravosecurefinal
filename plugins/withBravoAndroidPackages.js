/**
 * Expo config plugin — re-registers Bravo's hand-written Android native
 * modules in the generated MainApplication.kt on every prebuild.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * iOS already does this properly: the real sources live in `native/ios/` and
 * `withBravoFrameCryptor` copies + registers them on every prebuild, so
 * `expo prebuild` is safe there. Android had no equivalent. Its five package
 * registrations were hand-edited into MainApplication.kt — a file the Expo
 * template OWNS and regenerates — and the result was force-added to git.
 *
 * That shortcut works until the first prebuild, and then fails in the worst
 * possible way: the app still COMPILES and still SHIPS, but with E2EE call
 * frame crypto, the call foreground service, ringtones, battery optimisation
 * and call volume silently unregistered. There is no build error. You find out
 * from someone on a live protection mission.
 *
 * With this plugin, `expo prebuild` is safe on Android too.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY LOUD
 * -----------------
 * If the anchor cannot be found, this THROWS. A config plugin that silently
 * does nothing recreates the exact failure it was written to prevent — the
 * whole point is that a missing registration must stop the build, not reach a
 * device. Same reasoning as the "no silent stubs" rule in BravoMap.
