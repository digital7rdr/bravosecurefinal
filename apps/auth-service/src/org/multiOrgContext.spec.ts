/**
 * Channels vs2 item 4 — multi-organisation membership, and the header that says
 * WHICH one a request is about.
 *
 * Founder decision 2026-08-12: yes to multi-org, Option A — a manager's
 * authority follows the organisation they are viewing, with no cap on how many
 * they may hold.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SECURITY PROPERTY THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: the header NARROWS the
 * caller's real memberships and can never add one. If that ever stops holding,
 * one line of client code becomes cross-tenant access — a manager reading
 * another company's incident queue or approving its timesheets. Every test
 * below that names an org the caller does not hold expects the request to be
 * refused that org, not obeyed.
