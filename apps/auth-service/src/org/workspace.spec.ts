/**
 * Scope v2 Phase 6 — A5 "Create Org Workspace", and the owner it mints.
 *
 * THE DECISION THIS PINS. The only pre-existing way to become an org owner was
 * `POST /agents` with type='company', which flips the caller to
 * `role='service_provider'` — the security-services funnel, which routes them to
 * the provider home and the job marketplace. An Enterprise company that wants
 * internal department channels is not an agency (owner-decided 2026-08-04), so
 * this path must mint an owner WITHOUT that role grant.
 *
 * That is an ABSENCE, so it is asserted as one: no agents insert, no users
 * update, no role string anywhere in the service.
