  // BookingPushBridge is a stateless Redis publisher (RedisModule is @Global) —
  // a second instance here avoids importing OpsModule (same pattern as
  // AgentModule); powers the R-3 invite wakes.
  // OpsAuditService only needs the @Global DatabaseService (+ @Optional Sentry),
  // so providing it directly keeps `request-seats` off the whole OpsModule graph
  // too — it writes one ops-feed row (family seat-increase request).
  // FamilyQuotaService owns the spending-quota control plane (quota changes +
  // their audit trail, the credit-request lifecycle, threshold warnings). Same
  // dependency set as FamilyService, so it needs no extra providers.

  // linkPendingInvitesByPhone this line used to name has been deleted: it had no
  // caller, and pending-by-phone rows stopped being created in 2026-08.)
  // FamilyQuotaService is exported for the controller's quota routes only — the
  // spend path deliberately does NOT go through it (see its class comment).
