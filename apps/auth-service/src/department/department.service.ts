   * makes every manager a channel admin on the broadcast too, and someone has to

  /**
   * May `userId` delete this channel? ONE rule, because the client renders the
   * button from it and the server enforces it — two copies would disagree and
   * the disagreement would surface as a button that 403s.
   *
   * ── vs2 edge A4 (founder decision, 2026-08-13) ────────────────────────────
   *
   * Creator-only was too narrow to satisfy the PDF's own ask: a workspace OWNER
   * could not delete a channel a delegated manager had created, so Delete was
   * refused to the one person who governs the whole org. The rule is now
   * owner-OR-creator — but on the WORKSPACE TENANT ONLY. The agency arm's
   * `created_by` rule predates this review and has its own consumers, so it is
   * left exactly as it was.
   *
   * "Owner" needs no extra query: an Enterprise workspace is keyed on its
   * owner's account (`org_workspaces.owner_user_id`), and that same id is the
   * channel's `org_id` — so `userId === org_id` IS "I am the workspace owner".
   *
   * STATIC AND PURE, deliberately — the same shape as `mintRefusalFor` above,
   * and for the same reason. The first draft of this fix had the rule TWICE:
   * once here and once inlined in `listOrgChannels`, with a comment claiming
   * they were single-sourced. They were not, and they already disagreed: the
   * inline copy keyed the owner arm on the CALLER's org while this one keys it
   * on the ROW's, so a row from another org would render a Delete button that
   * the server then 403s. Unreachable only because that query happens to filter
   * `org_id` today — which is precisely the "equivalent today is how two readers
   * start to drift" argument the mint predicate 400 lines up already makes.
