/**
 * Channels vs2 item 2 — the three fields that make `parent_id: null`
 * unambiguous, plus `mintable_by_me`.
 *
 * WHY THESE ASSERT THE EMITTED VALUE, NOT THE TYPE.
 *
 * `listChannels` fills ChannelSummary through a raw `db.q<T>` cast, so adding a
 * field to the interface WITHOUT the SQL column typechecks perfectly and yields
 * `undefined` on every row at runtime. A test that only reads the type would be
 * green against a server that emits nothing — and the client's compat fallback
 * treats "absent" as "old server", so the whole tree would silently degrade to
 * a flat pile.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS FILE, stated honestly: the DB is MOCKED here, so everything
 * below is a claim about the SQL TEXT, not about what Postgres returns. It can
 * prove a column is projected and cannot prove the walk picks the right
 * ancestor. The semantics are covered by `test/integration/channelTree.itest.ts`
 * against a real Postgres — run it (`npm run test:integration`, needs Docker)
 * before trusting any change to this query.
