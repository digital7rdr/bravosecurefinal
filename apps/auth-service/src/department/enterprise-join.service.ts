/**
 * Enterprise Dept Channels scope v2 — Phase 3: the join → approve loop.
 *
 * Frames M5 (Join Workspace / Referral Request), M11A (Approval Result) and
 * A11 (Approvals / Notifications).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SERVICE, WITH ITS OWN TABLE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * M11A: "Pending means no Enterprise content or metadata is visible."
 * A11:  "Pending applicants receive no Department Channels, Attendance,
 *        Incident or Vault access."
 *
 * A pending request creates NO `org_members` row. Not because every reader
 * filters on `status = 'active'` — twelve of them do not, correctly, since an
 * admin roster must show suspended and removed members — but because **there is
 * no row at all**, so every read returns nothing whether it filters or not, in
 * today's modules and in ones added later. Approval is what creates the row.
 *
 * The module guard does not carry this either: `DeptChatAccessGuard` Path 3
 * admits an ACTIVE Enterprise-tier individual with no membership row (their org
 * is their own user id), and a pending joiner is very often exactly that person
 * — they had to pick a plan to reach M5. What protects the TARGET org is
 * org-id resolution: with no membership row their org resolves to themselves,
 * so they see their own empty workspace, never the Enterprise they applied to.

     * ⚠️ THE SERVER RULE IS THE REAL BOUNDARY, and that is why it exists here
     * as well as on the form. The client pre-flight reads `workspace_tenant`
     * from `listManagedChannels`, so ONE failed list load left `serverTenant`
     * undefined, the rule silently off, and a whole-workspace manager minted —
     * and an older APK bypassed it entirely. A constraint enforced only by the
     * screen that happens to have loaded is advisory, not a constraint.
     *
     * WORKSPACE TENANT ONLY: an agency has exactly one organisation, so the
     * rule would have no meaning there and would only block a legitimate
     * org-wide manager invite.
     *
     * AND ONLY WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO PICK. On a clean workspace with no
     * channels yet, "name an organisation" is unsatisfiable: the picker renders
     * "No organisations yet", and refusing here would make the first co-admin
     * of a brand-new workspace impossible to invite. With zero organisations
     * there are also no OTHER organisations to leak into, which is the entire
     * point of the rule. `mintable_by_me` is deliberately NOT consulted — this
     * asks whether a team COULD be named at all, not whether this particular
     * minter may name each one; that refusal is `assertMintableTeam`'s job and
     * it produces its own, more specific error.
