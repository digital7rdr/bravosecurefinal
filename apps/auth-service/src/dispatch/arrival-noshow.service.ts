/**
 * Sweep 3 — arrival no-show watchdog (BUILD_RUNBOOK Step 16 / LB13).
 *
 * DISTINCT from the Step 8 crew-SLA sweep (crew-sla.service.ts):
 *   • crew-SLA / AGENCY_NO_SHOW = agency accepted but never CREWED (no mission) by
 *     crew_deadline_at → TERMINAL, client refunded, agency breached.
 *   • THIS / arrival-no-show = agency crewed it (mission DISPATCHED) but the crew
 *     never ARRIVED (mission never reached PICKUP, pickup_at IS NULL) by
 *     arrival_deadline_at → NOT terminal. Re-dispatch the SAME booking to another
 *     agency. The escrow hold PERSISTS (HELD) — the client is NEVER re-charged; the
 *     replacement agency's accept() re-points the hold to itself (dispatch.service).
 *
 * On a hit it: flips CONFIRMED → DISPATCHING (a new SYSTEM transition, Step 16),
 * ABORTs the no-show mission + stands its crew down (so those CPOs free up), marks
 * the no-show agency's prior ACCEPTED offer SUPERSEDED (so the matchmaker never
 * re-offers it this booking), bumps that agency's reliability_breaches, then
 * re-enters DispatchService.offerNext to find the next-nearest eligible agency.
 *
 * Multi-pod safe via the Redis `SET NX` lock (LB9). DARK on AUTO_DISPATCH_ENABLED.
 *
 * ⚠️ SINGLE OWNER per concern: this is THE arrival-no-show sweep; crew-sla.service.ts
 * is THE crew-SLA sweep. They use DIFFERENT lock keys + scan DIFFERENT candidates
 * (no-mission vs mission-DISPATCHED-stale) so they never act on the same booking.
 *
 * MONEY: this sweep moves NO money. The hold stays HELD across the re-dispatch (the
 * one money-correctness rule vs the crew-SLA template, which REFUNDS because it is
 * terminal). Re-attribution of the hold's payee happens in the replacement accept().
