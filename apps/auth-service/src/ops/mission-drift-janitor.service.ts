 * LM-D1 — booking↔mission drift janitor.

 * A mission must never stay active (DISPATCHED/PICKUP/LIVE/SOS) once its booking is
 * terminal (COMPLETED/CANCELLED/NO_PROVIDER/AGENCY_NO_SHOW). Staging carried 8 such
 * rows (missions stuck LIVE since 2026-04-24 under CONFIRMED-then-closed bookings)
 * with no sweeper to close them — and every drifted mission pins its crew "busy"
 * via mission_crew_agent_active_uq, so those CPOs can never be re-crewed.
 *
 * Each hit: close the mission (COMPLETED when the booking completed, else ABORTED
 * with end_reason='drift_janitor'), stand the crew down, and log a warn — the log
 * line is the alert surface (Sentry picks up warn+). Deliberately NOT gated on
 * AUTO_DISPATCH_ENABLED: drift hurts legacy bookings the same way.
 *
 * Multi-pod safe via the Redis SET NX lock, mirroring the dispatch sweeps.
