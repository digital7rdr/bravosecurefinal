 * Cross-service bridge for booking + agent push notifications.
 *
 * Publishes opaque event correlation IDs on the shared Redis `push:events`
 * channel; messenger-service's PushService subscribes and ships ONLY the
 * opaque `eventClass` + `eventId` over FCM data. The mobile client uses
 * the opaque ID to pull encrypted event details via the JWT-gated
 * `/events/by-id/:eventId` route over the regular sealed-relay channel.
 *
 * P0-N8 — DO NOT add `bookingId`, `missionId`, the literal `kind` value,
 * or any user-identifying field to the published payload. FCM data fields
 * are cleartext between this server and the device; Google operates the
 * intermediary. Per-user real-time SOS / mission feeds would be visible.
 *
 * The event details (bookingId, missionId, kind specifics) are stored
 * Redis-side keyed by the opaque eventId with a short TTL (15 min, see
 * EVENT_TTL_SECONDS) and fetched via the encrypted relay. That way:
 *   - FCM sees: `{eventClass: 'sos', eventId: <opaque>, userId: <opaque>}`
 *   - Encrypted body delivered via sealed-sender envelope carries the rest.
 *
 * Same pattern as MissionEventsService — fire-and-forget, never throws,
 * a missed delivery falls back to the mobile client's in-app polling.
