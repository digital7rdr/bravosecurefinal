/**
 * Mission lifecycle — active execution of a confirmed booking.
 *
 *   CREWED → DISPATCHED → PICKUP → LIVE → COMPLETED
 *
 * 2026-09-04 (founder: "Accepted is not Dispatched"): crew-assignment now creates
 * the mission CREWED — the agency picked names, nobody has moved. The explicit
 * Dispatched action (agency manager or lead, both AGENT-side) flips it to
 * DISPATCHED and stamps `dispatched_at`; only then is the client told "Team
 * dispatched". PICKUP is reachable from DISPATCHED only, so a crew cannot
 * "arrive" before it was dispatched. `live_at` (PICKUP → LIVE, "client
 * received") stays the one authoritative start of the service window.
 *
 * Any non-terminal mission (CREWED/DISPATCHED/PICKUP/LIVE) can escalate to SOS —
 * the CPO's red alert, or the client's panic button (SYSTEM). From SOS we
 * recover to LIVE (false alarm), complete, or get ABORTED.
 *
 * Any non-terminal state can be ABORTED by Ops / Admin, or by SYSTEM (the
 * sweeps tearing down a stuck/orphaned mission). The drift-janitor may also
 * close an orphaned mission COMPLETED (SYSTEM) when its booking already did.
 *
 * The DB trigger `missions_fsm_check()` (20260904120001_mission_crewed_fsm.sql)
 * mirrors this graph minus the actor dimension; mission-state-machine.drift.spec
 * parses that file and fails if the two disagree.
