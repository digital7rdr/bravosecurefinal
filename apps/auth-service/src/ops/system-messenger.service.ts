/**
 * SystemMessengerService — server-authored announcements inside the
 * existing messenger primitives.
 *
 * Why we don't encrypt these:
 *  - message_envelopes are E2E with per-recipient ciphertext. The server
 *    never holds session keys, so it cannot write envelopes.
 *  - system_broadcasts are intentionally plaintext, written by the ops
 *    pipeline, and rendered client-side as inline cards alongside
 *    decrypted envelopes. They carry no confidential content (booking
 *    IDs + status events) — the sensitive crypto channel (envelopes) is
 *    unchanged.
 *
 * This service does two jobs:
 *   1. ensureSystemDirect(userId) — returns the direct conversation
 *      between a user and the Bravo System actor; creates it on first
 *      use so every client has one persistent "Bravo System" thread.
 *   2. createMissionOpsRoom(…)  — creates a group conversation for a
 *      mission and seeds the first system card. Reused by the booking
 *      approve + mission dispatch flows.
