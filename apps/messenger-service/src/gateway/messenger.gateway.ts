    //    (user, device) slot and its `onDisconnect` is skipped (presence
    //    audit fix #4), so a second INCR here leaks the counter and pins
    //    the user `online` forever even after every device has dropped.

    // 2. The STATE key. A socket is open, therefore this user IS reachable —
    //    so re-assert it on EVERY authenticated connect, not only when
    //    `onConnect` reports the first device cluster-wide.
    //
    //    This used to be gated on that first-device edge, which made
    //    `set('online')` the ONLY writer that can ever move a state key
    //    back up: `touch` just bumps TTLs, `reassertLocalLeases` only
    //    rewrites the lease, and `sweepStale` is strictly online→offline.
    //    So any moment the key went stale-`offline` while the socket was
    //    genuinely up — a sweep that raced a momentarily-missing lease, or
    //    an underflow `onDisconnect` after the counter was reset — the user
    //    was painted grey until they happened to background/foreground the
    //    app. Because the client pins `signalDeviceId = 1`, every reconnect
    //    that races the previous socket's teardown lands in the
    //    `superseded` branch and skipped the re-assert entirely, so this
    //    was reachable on a single device with no second device involved.
    //
    //    Clobbering a live `active`/`away` with `online` is safe and
    //    self-correcting: all three are non-offline, the client re-sends its
    //    real activity immediately after reconnecting (`setActivity`), and
    //    reporting a connected user as `online` is never a lie.
    //
    //    B-354 — EXCEPT for a self-declared background socket (killed-app
    //    headless drain): a wake-driven connect says nothing about the USER,
    //    so it must never assert presence UP. It stays in the counter/lease
    //    accounting above (envelope delivery + liveness need that), and gets
    //    one repair-only write DOWN: if nothing else is connected and the
    //    state key still claims non-offline, that record is a stale leftover
    //    from an ungraceful kill — and the bg socket's own lease would now
    //    shield it from sweepStale indefinitely. Flip it to offline (stamps

   * B-100/B-101 — in-place socket re-authentication.
   *
   * The socket binds to the handshake token's `jti` for its whole life,
   * but that jti's Redis allowlist key lives only as long as the access
   * token (15 min, and it is DEL'd the instant a refresh rotates the
   * session). The P0-6 sweep then disconnects the socket — which, for a
   * live call, is a death sentence (12s disconnect-bye / 10s SFU leave
   * grace) because the client's reconnect paths are frozen while the
   * screen is locked. Letting the client hand us its FRESH token and
   * swapping the claims in place removes the disconnect entirely.
   *
   * Security posture — this ADDS no authority and weakens nothing:
   *   • The new token gets the EXACT handshake treatment: HS256
   *     signature + `exp` + issuer/audience via `verifyAccessToken`,
   *     then the same `jti:<jti>` Redis allowlist check.
   *   • Identity is PINNED: a token for a different `sub` or a
   *     different `device_id` is refused, so a socket can never
   *     re-auth its way into another identity or device slot. The
   *     handshake-derived `signalDeviceId` / `sessionId` are untouched.
   *   • Revocation promptness is preserved (architecture contract
   *     "instant kill", MESSENGER_BACKEND.md): a revoked jti is absent
   *     from the allowlist, so re-auth is refused AND the 60s sweep
   *     still disconnects on the stale claims. We deliberately do NOT
   *     add a revocation grace or exempt in-call sockets from the
   *     sweep — both were considered and rejected as weakenings.
   *   • Failure is non-destructive: we keep the existing (already
   *     authenticated) claims and let the sweep act on them. A bad
   *     token cannot downgrade or hijack a healthy socket.
