/**
 * Push notification service (M12 + BE-4.3) — real FCM delivery.
 *
 * Two separate token channels:
 *   - DATA  (regular APNs / FCM)  — envelope-delivery wake hints
 *   - VOIP  (iOS PushKit / high-priority FCM) — inbound-call rings
 *
 * Why VoIP is separate:
 *   - iOS PushKit requires a distinct VoIP certificate + its own token.
 *   - Android: the same FCM token works for both, but we mark VoIP
 *     pushes as `priority=high` + `android.priority=high` so Doze mode
 *     bypasses kick in and the device wakes immediately.
 *
 * Firebase Admin SDK is initialised lazily on first send. Looks for
 * credentials in this order:
 *   1. GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var (path to service account
 *      JSON) — standard Google convention.
 *   2. /home/ubuntu/bravo/firebase-service-account.json — staging EC2
 *      conventional path.
 *   3. ./firebase-service-account.json relative to the running process.
 *
 * If none are found, sends are no-ops with a one-time warning logged
 * (so dev environments without credentials don't spam the logs and
 * tests don't have to mock the SDK).
 *
 * PERMANENT RULE (enforced by log-audit test):
 *   Push payloads NEVER carry message content. Wake hints only.
 *   App pulls from /envelopes after wake. Applies to VoIP too — the
 *   VoIP payload is just `{kind: 'voip-wake', callId}`.

   * Push audit P0-N4 — the `keyPrefix` parameter is REQUIRED. The
   * previous version hardcoded the scan to `VOIP_KEY_PREFIX` even
   * when called from `sendDataOnlyToUser` / `sendChatWake` /
   * `sendBookingPush` (which pull from `DATA_KEY_PREFIX`). On
   * Android fcmBootstrap registers the SAME FCM token under BOTH
   * prefixes; the result was:
   *   • dead DATA entries never cleaned (wrong-prefix scan never
   *     matched the right key),
   *   • the matching VOIP entry was wrongly deleted as a side effect
   *     when the chat-wake FCM returned `not-registered` for the
   *     shared token.
   * After the first dead-token chat-wake, the user's incoming-call
   * channel silently died — sendVoipWake then logged "no-tokens"
   * and every call dropped before ringing.
   *
   * The fix: caller passes the prefix it actually scanned, and the
   * reap matches by TOKEN VALUE in BOTH keyspaces.
   *
   * B-48 (2026-07-05) — reaping only the scanned keyspace created the
   * half-alive state: on Android the SAME FCM token lives under both
   * prefixes, and `registration-token-not-registered` means the token
   * itself is dead (uninstall / data clear / rotation) — dead for both
   * channels. Deleting only the DATA copy left a dead VOIP twin, so
   * messages logged `no-tokens` while calls fired into the void (and
   * vice versa). Now a dead token is dropped from BOTH keyspaces by
   * exact token match — inherently safe on iOS, where the APNs VoIP
   * token differs from the FCM token and simply never matches.
